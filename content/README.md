# Content Packs

Content packs define worlds, missions, factions, items, and style profiles. Packs are local JSON bundles that can be imported/exported.

## Structure
- `content/packs/worlds/*.json` — sector/biome/faction definitions and style guides
- `content/packs/missions/*.json` — mission objective graphs, modes, rewards
- `content/packs/items/*.json` — optional items/artifacts

## Image Style Profiles
- Each world may define a `style_profile` used by the image generator for coherent visuals
