#### New API Endpoints (`src/server/psychology/psychologyRoutes.ts`)
Added 8 new integration endpoints:
- `POST /api/psychology/integration/voting-analysis`
- `POST /api/psychology/integration/legal-compliance`
- `POST /api/psychology/integration/security-threat-response`
- `POST /api/psychology/integration/lifecycle-decisions`
- `POST /api/psychology/integration/technology-adoption`
- `POST /api/psychology/integration/entrepreneurship-analysis`
- `POST /api/psychology/integration/batch-analysis`
- `GET /api/psychology/integration/capabilities`

#### Enhanced Demo Interface (`src/demo/psychology.ts`)
- Added integration badges for all connected systems
- Detailed system descriptions for each integration
- Interactive testing functions for individual and batch analysis
- Comprehensive CSS styling for integration components

## üîß Key Features

### Cross-System Psychology
Psychology insights now inform all major game systems for realistic behavioral modeling:
- **Governance**: Predicts voting patterns and political engagement
- **Legal**: Models compliance behavior and deterrence effectiveness
- **Security**: Analyzes threat perception and cooperation levels
- **Demographics**: Influences lifecycle and migration decisions
- **Technology**: Predicts adoption rates and innovation contribution
- **Business**: Assesses entrepreneurship potential and business preferences

### Batch Analysis Capability
- Analyze multiple citizen profiles simultaneously across all integrated systems
- Efficient processing for large-scale population analysis
- Comprehensive results aggregation and reporting

### Predictive Modeling
- Sophisticated algorithms predict individual responses to policy changes
- Real-time behavioral analysis during gameplay
- Dynamic citizen behavior based on psychological profiles

## üìä Demo Access

### Interactive Testing
**Psychology Demo**: `http://localhost:4010/demo/psychology`
- View integration badges and system connections
- Test individual system integrations
- Run batch analysis across multiple profiles
- Explore psychological modeling capabilities

### API Testing Examples

#### Governance Integration
```bash
POST /api/psychology/integration/voting-analysis
{
  "profileId": "citizen_123",
  "election": {
    "candidates": [
      {"id": "candidate_1", "platform": ["economy", "security"]}
    ]
  }
}
```

#### Technology Integration
```bash
POST /api/psychology/integration/technology-adoption
{
  "profileId": "citizen_123",
  "technology": {
    "id": "neural_interface",
    "category": "Consciousness",
    "complexity": 7
  }
}
```

#### Batch Analysis
```bash
POST /api/psychology/integration/batch-analysis
{
  "profileIds": ["citizen_1", "citizen_2", "citizen_3"],
  "analysisTypes": ["voting", "legal", "security", "technology", "business"],
  "context": {
    "election": {...},
    "law": {...},
    "threat": {...},
    "technology": {...}
  }
}
```

## üöÄ Impact on Game Systems

### Enhanced Realism
- Citizens now respond to policies based on their psychological profiles
- Voting behavior reflects personality traits and values
- Technology adoption varies by individual psychology
- Legal compliance depends on moral alignment and risk tolerance

### Strategic Depth
- Leaders must consider citizen psychology when implementing policies
- Different personality types respond differently to the same policies
- Psychological analysis helps predict policy outcomes
- Enables targeted policy design for specific population segments

### Behavioral Economics Integration
- Psychology principles now influence economic decisions
- Entrepreneurship varies by personality and risk tolerance
- Innovation contribution depends on psychological factors
- Career choices reflect individual psychology and values

## üìà Next Steps

With Psychology Integration complete, the system now provides comprehensive behavioral modeling across all major game systems. The next recommended tasks are:

1. **Task 68: AI Analysis Engine** - Implement AI-powered analysis providing natural language interpretation of economic, social, and technological dynamics
2. **Task 69: Advanced Game Modes** - Implement COOP, Achievement, Conquest, and Hero game modes with unique objectives and mechanics
3. **Task 70: Visual Systems Integration** - Implement AI-generated graphics and videos with visual consistency management

## ‚úÖ Completion Status

**Psychology System Integration (Task 66)** is now **COMPLETED** with full integration across governance, legal, security, demographics, technology, and business systems. The psychology engine now serves as the behavioral foundation for realistic citizen modeling throughout the entire game simulation.
