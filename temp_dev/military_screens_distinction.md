## Clear Separation of Concerns

### Military Screen (Operational)

- **Who**: Individual commanders and units
- **How**: Tactical execution and logistics

### Defense Screen (Strategic Policy)
- **What**: Overall defense strategy and policy
- **When**: Long-term planning and cycles
- **Where**: National and international scope
- **Who**: Defense Secretary and civilian leadership
- **How**: Policy framework and resource allocation

### Joint Chiefs Screen (Command Structure)
- **What**: Military leadership and command
- **When**: Strategic planning and coordination
- **Where**: Service-wide and joint operations
- **Who**: Senior military officers and service chiefs

## API Endpoints Distinction

### Military Screen APIs
- `/api/military/fleets` - Fleet status and management
- `/api/military/bases` - Base operations and logistics
- `/api/military/threats` - Tactical threat alerts
- `/api/military/deploy` - Deployment commands
- `/api/military/readiness` - Operational readiness

### Defense Screen APIs
- `/api/defense/dashboard` - Defense policy overview
- `/api/defense/policy` - Defense policy framework
- `/api/defense/strategic-planning` - Strategic planning data
- `/api/defense/threat-assessment` - Strategic threat analysis
- `/api/defense/budget` - Defense budget allocation

### Joint Chiefs Screen APIs
- `/api/joint-chiefs/roster` - Joint Chiefs and service chiefs
- `/api/joint-chiefs/command-structure` - Command hierarchy
- `/api/joint-chiefs/strategic-planning` - Joint strategic planning
- `/api/joint-chiefs/appointments` - Leadership appointments

## User Workflow Integration

### Typical User Journey:
1. **Defense Screen**: Set overall defense policy and strategy
2. **Joint Chiefs Screen**: Appoint leadership and establish command structure
3. **Military Screen**: Execute operations and manage day-to-day military activities

### Information Flow:
- Defense policy (Defense Screen) → Strategic implementation (Joint Chiefs) → Operational execution (Military)
- Threat intelligence flows upward: Tactical threats (Military) → Strategic assessment (Joint Chiefs) → Policy response (Defense)

## Benefits of This Separation

1. **Clarity**: Each screen has a clear, distinct purpose
2. **Scalability**: Each screen can be developed independently
3. **User Experience**: Users know exactly where to find specific information
4. **Realism**: Mirrors real-world separation between policy, command, and operations
5. **Maintainability**: Reduces code overlap and complexity

## Implementation Status

- ✅ **Military Screen**: Updated with operational focus and clear documentation
- ✅ **Defense Screen**: Newly created with comprehensive policy and strategic planning features
- ✅ **Joint Chiefs Screen**: Updated with command hierarchy focus and clear documentation
- ✅ **Screen Factory**: Updated to use new DefenseScreen
