# Pages Directory Migration - COMPLETED

## ✅ **Successfully Migrated and Deleted `src/pages` Directory**

The `src/pages` directory contained Next.js API routes that needed to be converted to Express routes and integrated into the main server architecture.

### **📁 What Was Found:**

- **`src/pages/api/sim/step.ts`** - Next.js API route for simulation step execution

### **🔄 Migration Actions:**

1. **Converted Next.js Route to Express Route:**
   - **Source:** `src/pages/api/sim/step.ts` (Next.js handler)
   - **Target:** `src/simulation/routes/stepRoutes.ts` (Express router)
   - **Changes:**
     - Converted from `NextApiRequest/NextApiResponse` to Express `Request/Response`
     - Wrapped in Express router factory function
     - Maintained all original functionality and validation

2. **Updated Test Files:**
   - **File:** `tests/api/sim.test.ts`
   - **Changes:**
     - Removed Next.js test server setup
     - Updated to use Express app with simulation routes
     - All test cases preserved and functional

3. **Integrated into Main Server:**
   - **File:** `src/server/index.ts`
   - **Changes:**
     - Added import for `createStepRoutes`
     - Fixed broken simulation engine imports (corrected paths)
     - Registered `/api/sim` routes in both success and fallback scenarios
     - Added proper logging for route registration

4. **Fixed Import Paths:**
   - Corrected simulation engine imports from `./sim-engine/` to `../simulation/engine/`
   - Corrected schema imports to `../simulation/routes/`

### **🗑️ Directory Deleted:**

- **Entire `src/pages/` directory** removed after successful migration

### **✅ Benefits Achieved:**

1. **Unified Architecture:**
   - All API routes now use Express instead of mixed Next.js/Express
   - Consistent routing pattern throughout the application
   - Single server architecture without Next.js dependencies

2. **Better Integration:**
   - Simulation step API now properly integrated with main server
   - Routes available in both sim engine success and fallback scenarios
   - Proper error handling and logging

3. **Improved Testing:**
   - Tests now use Express app directly
   - More reliable test setup without Next.js API resolver
   - Consistent with other API tests

4. **Cleaner Structure:**
   - Simulation routes properly organized in `src/simulation/routes/`
   - No orphaned Next.js pages directory
   - Clear separation of concerns

### **🔗 API Endpoints Available:**

- **`POST /api/sim/step`** - Execute simulation step
  - **Parameters:** `campaignId`, `seed`, `actions[]`
  - **Returns:** Simulation results with step data, resources, buildings, KPIs
  - **Validation:** Requires campaignId and seed
  - **Error Handling:** Proper HTTP status codes and error messages

### **📊 Final Structure:**

```

├── simulation/
│   └── routes/
│       ├── stepRoutes.ts        # ✅ NEW: Basic simulation step API
│       ├── simEngineRoutes.ts   # ✅ FIXED: Advanced AI simulation engine
│       └── simEngineSchema.ts   # ✅ FIXED: Schema definitions

        └── sim.test.ts          # ✅ UPDATED: Uses Express instead of Next.js
```

## 🎉 **MIGRATION COMPLETE**

The `src/pages` directory has been successfully migrated and deleted. The Next.js API route has been converted to a proper Express route and integrated into the main server architecture. All functionality is preserved and properly tested.

**Total Impact:**
- ✅ **Migrated:** 1 Next.js API route → Express route
- ✅ **Updated:** Test files and server integration
- ✅ **Fixed:** Broken simulation engine import paths
- ✅ **Deleted:** Obsolete pages directory
- 🚀 **Improved:** Unified Express-based architecture
