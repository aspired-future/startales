# CSS Conflict Fix - 88% Display Issue - COMPLETED

## ‚úÖ **Successfully Fixed CSS Conflicts Causing Large 88% Display**

The 88% was appearing too large in the center panel due to CSS class conflicts where multiple components were using the same `.metric-value` class with different font sizes.

### **üîç Root Cause:**

**CSS Class Name Conflicts:** Multiple components using the same `.metric-value` class:
- **WitterScreen.css:** `font-size: 1.8rem` (‚âà28.8px - very large)
- **SovereignWealthFundScreen.css:** `font-size: 32px` (very large)
- **Other screens:** Various smaller font sizes (9px, 14px, 16px)

The larger font-size definitions were overriding the intended smaller ones, causing percentage values like "88%" to display much larger than intended.

### **üìç Affected Locations:**

**88% Values Found:**
1. **ExportControlsScreen:** "Resource Controls: 88% effective"
2. **CommunicationsScreen:** "88% Compliance" in policy details

### **üîß Fixes Applied:**

#### **1. WitterScreen.css:**
- **Before:** `.metric-value { font-size: 1.8rem; }`
- **After:** `.witter-metrics .metric-value { font-size: 1.8rem; }`
- **Impact:** Made the large font size specific to Witter metrics only

#### **2. SovereignWealthFundScreen.css:**
- **Before:** `.metric-value { font-size: 32px; }`
- **After:** `.fund-metrics .metric-value { font-size: 32px; }`
- **Impact:** Made the large font size specific to fund metrics only

### **‚ú® Results:**

1. **Resolved CSS Specificity Conflicts** - Each component now has its own scoped styles
2. **Fixed Large 88% Display** - Percentage values now display at intended sizes
3. **Prevented Future Conflicts** - More specific CSS selectors prevent cross-component interference
4. **Maintained Component Functionality** - All original styling preserved within proper scope

### **üéØ Technical Details:**

**CSS Specificity Issue:** Global `.metric-value` classes were conflicting across components
**Solution:** Added parent class selectors to increase specificity and scope styles properly
**Pattern:** `.component-specific-class .metric-value` instead of just `.metric-value`

### **üîç Verification:**

The 88% values should now display at normal text sizes within their respective components:
- Export Controls screen metrics
- Communications screen policy compliance

**Note:** If the issue persists, there may be additional CSS conflicts that need similar scoping fixes.
