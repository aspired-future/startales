# Fiscal Policy Simulation Integration Design

## Overview
Connect government fiscal decisions with game simulation to make spending and taxation have real impacts on civilization development.

## Key Features
- Government spending improves infrastructure, military, research, and social outcomes
- Tax policies affect economic behavior and growth patterns  
- Inflation impacts purchasing power and competitiveness
- Fiscal effects feed into natural language narrative generation

## Core Components
1. Fiscal Effect Calculator - computes simulation impacts
2. Simulation State Manager - updates game parameters
3. Behavioral Response Modeler - models tax effects
4. Narrative Input Generator - creates story elements
5. Economic Multiplier Engine - applies realistic multipliers

## Integration Points
- Treasury System: budget execution triggers effects
- Central Bank: monetary-fiscal coordination
- Economic Simulation: GDP/inflation calculations
- Natural Language: policy narratives

This makes fiscal policy strategic with visible consequences.
