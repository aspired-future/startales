## üéØ **DEMO FUNCTIONALITY**

The Sprint 3 demo showcases the complete **approve policy ‚Üí step ‚Üí KPI delta** workflow:

1. **Policy Creation**: Enter free-form text like "Increase military spending by 40%"
2. **AI Parsing**: System converts text to structured modifiers with caps and risk assessment
3. **Policy Approval**: Review and activate policies through the UI
4. **Advisor Consultation**: Query domain experts and get policy proposals
5. **Simulation Integration**: Execute steps with active policy modifiers applied

## üìä **Technical Implementation**

### Policy Engine Features:
- **Natural Language Processing**: Rule-based parsing of policy intentions
- **Automatic Capping**: Global maximum caps (200% max effect) prevent game-breaking policies
- **Risk Calculation**: Automatic risk assessment based on policy impact magnitude
- **Modifier Types**: Support for resource, building, research, military, population, and trade modifiers

### Advisor System Features:
- **Domain Expertise**: 5 specialized advisors with distinct personalities and expertise areas
- **Context Awareness**: Responses incorporate current campaign state (resources, buildings, KPIs)
- **Confidence Scoring**: Responses include confidence levels and source attribution
- **Policy Proposals**: Advisors can propose specific policies based on campaign conditions

### Database Integration:
- **Policy Tables**: Complete schema for policies and policy modifiers
- **Campaign Integration**: Policies linked to specific campaigns with proper foreign keys
- **Status Management**: Full lifecycle tracking from draft to active/expired
- **Statistics**: Real-time policy statistics and filtering capabilities
