## Implementation Status

✅ **Completed:**
- Created new AI content generation functions

- Integrated with existing engagement calculation system

⚠️ **Partially Complete:**
- Old template code still exists in the file and needs cleanup

## Next Steps

2. Test the new content generation
3. Verify content distribution matches requirements
4. Ensure all content is story-relevant and entertaining

## Demo Access

The new system is accessible at:

## Technical Details

The new system uses three main content generation functions:

Each function contains multiple pre-written, high-quality posts that are selected randomly to ensure variety without repetition.
