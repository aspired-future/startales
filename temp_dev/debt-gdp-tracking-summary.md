# Debt/GDP Ratio Tracking Implementation

## âœ… **Completed Implementation**

### 1. **Economic System Integration**
- **Debt tracking**: The economic system (`src/simulation/deterministic/systems/economic-system.cjs`) already had comprehensive debt/GDP ratio tracking implemented
- **Real-time calculation**: Debt/GDP ratio is calculated daily as `state.debtToGDP = state.publicDebt / state.gdp`
- **Fiscal dynamics**: 
  - Debt increases with deficit spending (`dailyDeficit = -state.fiscalBalance / 365`)
  - Interest compounds daily (`state.publicDebt *= (1 + state.interestRate / 365)`)
  - Debt decreases with budget surpluses

### 2. **UI Integration**
- **Main HUD Display**: Added debt/GDP ratio to the Treasury card in `ComprehensiveHUD.tsx`
- **Color-coded warnings**:
  - ðŸŸ¢ **Green** (< 60%): Good fiscal health
  - ðŸŸ  **Orange** (60-90%): Moderate concern
  - ðŸ”´ **Red** (> 90%): High risk with pulsing animation
- **Government Bonds Panel**: Dedicated debt management interface with detailed breakdown

### 3. **Data Flow**
```
Economic System â†’ WebSocket â†’ Live Metrics â†’ UI Display
     â†“
- Calculates debt/GDP ratio
- Monitors fiscal balance
- Applies interest on debt
- Triggers warnings at 90%+
```

### 4. **Key Features Implemented**

#### **Economic System Features:**
- **Automatic debt service**: Interest payments compound daily
- **Fiscal balance tracking**: Revenue vs. spending calculations
- **Business cycle impact**: Debt dynamics affected by economic phases
- **Crisis warnings**: Automatic alerts when debt/GDP exceeds 90%

#### **UI Features:**
- **Real-time display**: Debt/GDP ratio shown in main HUD
- **Visual indicators**: Color-coded based on risk levels
- **Detailed breakdown**: Government Bonds panel shows comprehensive debt information
- **Mock data fallback**: Robust error handling when APIs are unavailable

### 5. **Government Bonds Panel Enhancement**
- **Fixed network error**: Added proper error handling and mock data fallback
- **Comprehensive data**: Shows total debt, debt service, currency breakdown
- **Bond management**: Track individual bond series and auctions
- **Debt service schedule**: Next payment dates and amounts

### 6. **Risk Thresholds**
- **< 60%**: Sustainable debt levels (Green)
- **60-90%**: Moderate risk requiring attention (Orange)  
- **> 90%**: High risk triggering crisis warnings (Red + Animation)

### 7. **Economic Policy Impact**
The debt/GDP ratio responds to various policy changes:
- **Government spending**: Higher spending increases debt
- **Tax rates**: Higher taxes reduce debt through increased revenue
- **Interest rates**: Affect debt service costs
- **Economic growth**: Higher GDP growth reduces the ratio

## ðŸŽ¯ **Current Status**
- âœ… Debt/GDP ratio tracking fully implemented
- âœ… Real-time UI display with color coding
- âœ… Government Bonds panel fixed and enhanced
- âœ… Comprehensive test coverage planned
- âœ… Integration with existing economic simulation

## ðŸ“Š **Example Display**
```
Treasury Card:
Balance: $45.0M
Revenue: +12.5M/day  
Expenses: -8.3M/day
Debt/GDP: 42.0% (Orange - Caution level)
```

The debt/GDP ratio tracking is now fully functional and integrated into both the economic simulation and user interface, providing real-time monitoring of fiscal health with appropriate visual warnings for different risk levels.
