# Player-Centric Government System Design

## Overview
This document outlines the updated government system architecture that maximizes player (leader) control while providing realistic advisory institutions. The key principle is that **the player retains final authority over all major decisions** while receiving expert advice and facing realistic consequences for their choices.

## Core Philosophy: Advisory, Not Authoritative

### **Player Authority Principles**
1. **Ultimate Decision Power**: The leader can approve, modify, or reject any recommendation
2. **No Institutional Override**: No institution can force the leader to take specific actions
3. **Consequence-Based Gameplay**: Decisions have realistic political, economic, and social consequences
4. **Expert Advisory**: Institutions provide high-quality analysis and recommendations
5. **Credibility Systems**: Institutional influence varies based on expertise and public trust

## Major Advisory Institutions

### üè¶ **Central Bank (Advisory Model)**

#### **What They Do:**
- **Monetary Policy Recommendations**: Interest rates, quantitative easing, reserve requirements
- **Economic Analysis**: Inflation forecasts, growth projections, financial stability assessments
- **Crisis Response Advice**: Emergency lending, bailout recommendations, market interventions
- **Currency Policy Guidance**: Exchange rate strategies, intervention recommendations

#### **What The Leader Controls:**
- **Final Monetary Policy Decisions**: Accept, modify, or reject all central bank recommendations
- **Interest Rate Setting**: Ultimate authority over all rates regardless of central bank advice
- **Emergency Actions**: Can override central bank crisis recommendations
- **Appointment Authority**: Can appoint/remove central bank leadership
- **Mandate Modification**: Can change central bank objectives and priorities

#### **Consequence System:**
```typescript
interface CentralBankConsequences {
  marketReactions: {
    currencyMovement: number; // immediate market response
    bondYields: number; // investor confidence changes
    inflationExpectations: number; // long-term price stability
  };
  institutionalRelations: {
    centralBankCredibility: number; // affects future recommendation quality
    resignationRisk: number; // leadership may resign in protest
    internationalStanding: number; // global central bank community relations
  };
  politicalImpact: {
    publicApproval: number; // citizen reaction to economic policies
    legislativeSupport: number; // political backing changes
    oppositionCriticism: string[]; // specific attack vectors
  };
}
```

### ‚öñÔ∏è **Supreme Court (Advisory Model)**

#### **What They Do:**
- **Constitutional Analysis**: Review laws and policies for constitutional compliance
- **Legal Recommendations**: Suggest modifications to ensure legal soundness
- **Precedent Analysis**: Explain how decisions align with or break from legal precedent
- **Rights Impact Assessment**: Analyze effects on civil liberties and constitutional rights

#### **What The Leader Controls:**

- **Constitutional Interpretation**: Ultimate authority over what the constitution means
- **Judicial Appointments**: Can appoint/remove justices (subject to constitutional process)
- **Court Jurisdiction**: Can modify what cases the court can review
- **Implementation Decisions**: Can choose how to implement court recommendations

#### **Consequence System:**
```typescript
interface SupremeCourtConsequences {
  legalLegitimacy: {
    constitutionalAuthority: number; // perceived legitimacy of government actions
    legalCommunitySupport: number; // lawyer and judge approval
    internationalLegalStanding: number; // global legal community respect
  };
  publicReaction: {
    civilRightsGroups: number; // activist organization responses
    publicTrust: number; // general citizen confidence in legal system
    protestRisk: number; // likelihood of civil unrest
  };
  institutionalImpact: {
    courtCredibility: number; // affects future recommendation quality
    justiceResignations: number; // risk of judicial resignations
    legalChallenges: number; // increased litigation risk
  };
}
```

## Enhanced Decision-Making Interface

### **Recommendation Presentation System**

#### **Multi-Option Analysis**
Every major decision presents the leader with:
1. **Institution Recommendation**: Official advice with full analysis
2. **Alternative Options**: Other viable approaches with trade-offs
3. **Risk Assessment**: Potential consequences of each choice
4. **Implementation Guidance**: How to execute each option effectively
5. **Exit Strategies**: How to reverse course if needed

#### **Consequence Forecasting**
```typescript
interface DecisionConsequencePreview {
  shortTerm: {
    immediate: ConsequenceSet; // 0-30 days
    nearTerm: ConsequenceSet; // 1-6 months
  };
  longTerm: {
    mediumTerm: ConsequenceSet; // 6 months - 2 years
    longTerm: ConsequenceSet; // 2+ years
  };
  uncertainty: {
    confidenceLevel: number; // 0-100 how certain the predictions are
    keyVariables: string[]; // factors that could change outcomes
    alternativeScenarios: Scenario[]; // other possible outcomes
  };
}
```

### **Dynamic Influence System**
