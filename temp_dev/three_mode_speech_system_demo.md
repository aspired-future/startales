## Technical Implementation

### Backend Changes

**File**: `src/server/leader-communications/types.ts`
```typescript
// Updated type definitions
deliveryMode?: 'automated' | 'teleprompter' | 'off-the-cuff';
```

**File**: `src/server/leader-communications/LeaderSpeechEngine.ts`
```typescript
private getDeliveryModeMultiplier(deliveryMode: 'automated' | 'teleprompter' | 'off-the-cuff'): number {
  switch (deliveryMode) {
    case 'off-the-cuff':
      return 1.5; // 50% higher impact - most authentic and engaging
    case 'teleprompter':
      return 1.2; // 20% higher impact - professional and prepared
    case 'automated':
    default:
      return 1.0; // Baseline impact - basic AI-generated delivery
  }
}
```

**Enhanced AI Prompt Context**:
```
- Delivery mode impact:
  * Automated: Basic delivery, minimal personal engagement, standard AI-generated content
  * Teleprompter: Professional, polished, prepared delivery with leader engagement
  * Off-the-cuff: Most authentic and relatable, shows confidence and spontaneity, highest emotional impact
```

### Frontend Changes

**File**: `src/ui_frontend/components/GameHUD/screens/extracted/SpeechesScreen.tsx`

**Three-Mode Selector**:
- ðŸ¤– Automated: "AI-generated speech delivered automatically"
- ðŸ“º Teleprompter: "Prepared, polished delivery with script"
- ðŸŽ¤ Off-the-Cuff: "Spontaneous, authentic delivery"

**Visual Impact Comparison**:
- Side-by-side comparison of all three modes
- Color-coded metrics (red for low, orange for medium, green for high)
- Clear impact multipliers displayed (1.0x, 1.2x, 1.5x)

**File**: `src/ui_frontend/components/GameHUD/screens/extracted/SpeechesScreen.css`

**Three-Column Layout**:
```css
.comparison-grid.three-modes {
  grid-template-columns: 1fr 1fr 1fr;
  gap: 1.5rem;
}

.mode-comparison.automated-mode {
  border-color: rgba(244, 67, 54, 0.5); /* Red for baseline */
}

.mode-comparison.teleprompter-mode {
  border-color: rgba(33, 150, 243, 0.5); /* Blue for enhanced */
}

.mode-comparison.off-the-cuff-mode {
  border-color: rgba(76, 175, 80, 0.5); /* Green for maximum */
}
```

## User Experience Flow

### 1. Speech Creation Process
1. Click "New Speech" in Speeches tab
2. Fill basic information (type, audience, occasion, tone, duration)
3. Add key messages (what to communicate)
4. Add issues to address (challenges/topics)
5. **Select delivery mode** with clear impact visualization:
   - See side-by-side comparison of all three modes
   - Understand trade-offs between efficiency, professionalism, and impact
   - Choose based on situation and desired outcome

### 2. Strategic Decision Making
Players must consider:
- **Time vs Impact**: Automated is fastest but least effective
- **Risk vs Reward**: Off-the-cuff has highest impact but requires confidence
- **Situation Appropriateness**: Formal events may favor teleprompter, crises favor off-the-cuff

### 3. Simulation Effects
All speech effects (morale, approval, economic confidence, etc.) are multiplied by delivery mode:
- **Automated**: Standard baseline effects
- **Teleprompter**: 20% stronger effects across all metrics
- **Off-the-Cuff**: 50% stronger effects across all metrics

## Gameplay Strategy

### When to Use Each Mode

**Automated Mode**:
- Routine announcements
- Low-stakes communications
- When time is critical
- Safe fallback option

**Teleprompter Mode**:
- Important policy announcements
- Formal diplomatic addresses
- When professionalism is paramount
- Complex topics requiring precision

**Off-the-Cuff Mode**:
- Crisis situations requiring authentic leadership
- Rally speeches to boost morale
- When showing confidence is crucial
- High-stakes moments requiring maximum impact

### Risk/Reward Balance

**Low Risk, Low Reward**: Automated
- Safe, predictable, but limited impact
- Good for maintaining baseline communication

**Medium Risk, Medium Reward**: Teleprompter
- Professional appearance with enhanced impact
- Balanced approach for most situations

**High Risk, High Reward**: Off-the-Cuff
- Maximum impact but requires leader confidence
- Best for critical moments requiring authentic leadership

The system is fully implemented with:
- âœ… Three distinct delivery modes with clear characteristics
- âœ… Proper impact hierarchy (1.0x â†’ 1.2x â†’ 1.5x)
- âœ… Visual comparison interface showing trade-offs
- âœ… Backend simulation effect multipliers
