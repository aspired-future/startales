# Sprint 9: Immigration & Migration System Demo Guide

## üåç System Overview

The Immigration & Migration System provides comprehensive population movement modeling with legal/illegal immigration, internal migration, cultural integration, and policy effects. This system creates realistic migration ecosystems where government policies, economic opportunities, and social factors have measurable impacts on population movement and integration outcomes.
