# AI Prompt System Enhancements

## ðŸŽ¯ Problem Analysis

The original AI prompts were severely limited:

### **Before (Issues Identified):**
- **Tiny prompts**: Just user message + 1-2 sentence instruction
- **Limited context**: Only 5 messages of history
- **No story integration**: Missing Game Master narrative context
- **Small model**: llama3.2:1b with only 4000 tokens
- **No world state**: Missing civilization, mission, and diplomatic context
- **Poor continuity**: Characters had no memory of ongoing situations

### **Prompt Size Comparison:**
- **Old prompt**: ~200-400 characters
- **New prompt**: ~3000-8000+ characters (15-20x larger!)

## ðŸš€ Comprehensive Solution Implemented

### **1. ConversationContextService**
Created a new service that gathers:

#### **Conversation Memory:**
