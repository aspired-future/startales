# 🎤 **Real Voice with STT/TTS - Transcripts Only**

## ✅ **Perfect Voice Implementation!**

### 🔧 **What's Implemented:**

1. **Real Voice Recording** 
   - ✅ Uses MediaRecorder API for actual voice recording
   - ✅ Microphone permission handling
   - ✅ Real-time recording with visual feedback

2. **Speech-to-Text (STT)**
   - ✅ Records audio and sends to STT service
   - ✅ Gets transcript from backend STT endpoint
   - ✅ **Audio discarded after transcription**
   - ✅ Only transcript saved to database

3. **Text-to-Speech (TTS)**
   - ✅ AI responses are spoken aloud
   - ✅ Character-appropriate voice selection
   - ✅ Natural speech synthesis
   - ✅ Visual feedback when character is speaking

4. **Transcript-Only Storage**
   - ✅ Audio files never saved to disk
   - ✅ Only text transcripts stored in database
   - ✅ Voice messages marked with 🎤 icon
   - ✅ Full conversation history preserved

### 🎯 **How It Works:**

#### **Voice Recording Flow:**
1. **Click "Start Recording"** → Microphone starts recording
2. **Speak your message** → Red recording indicator shows
3. **Click "Stop & Transcribe"** → Audio sent to STT service
4. **Audio transcribed** → Text extracted, audio discarded
5. **Transcript saved** → Only text stored in database
6. **AI responds** → Character generates contextual response
7. **TTS speaks response** → AI response spoken aloud

#### **Visual Feedback:**
- 🎙️ **Ready to record**
- 🔴 **Recording in progress**  
- 🔄 **Processing voice** (STT conversion)
- 🔊 **Character speaking** (TTS playback)

#### **User Experience:**
```
Voice Mode Interface:
