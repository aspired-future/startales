# Planetary Government System Design

## Overview
Implement automated planetary-level government systems that manage planets similar to how city management works, but at a larger scale with multiple cities, regions, and planetary-wide policies.

## Core Concept
Each planet within a civilization has its own automated government that handles:
- **Local Governance**: Managing multiple cities and regions on the planet
- **Resource Management**: Planetary resource allocation and distribution
- **Infrastructure**: Planet-wide infrastructure projects and maintenance
- **Economic Policy**: Planetary economic planning and trade coordination
- **Population Management**: Migration, housing, employment across the planet
- **Environmental Management**: Planetary ecosystem and sustainability
- **Defense Coordination**: Local defense and security coordination with civilization

## Next Steps
1. Create database schema and migrations
2. Implement service layer with basic government operations
3. Build API endpoints for government management
4. Create UI components and integrate with HUD
5. Implement AI knobs and simulation integration
6. Add WebSocket support for real-time updates
7. Test with existing city and civilization systems

This system will provide rich, automated planetary governance that scales with civilization growth while maintaining player control over strategic decisions.
