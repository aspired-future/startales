# Performance-Optimized Hybrid Simulation Design

## ðŸš¨ **10Hz Performance Analysis**

### **Current System Load Per Tick**
- **Database Transaction**: Full PostgreSQL transaction with state load/save
- **7 Sequential Reducers**: Production, Queues, Logistics, Prices, Readiness/Science, Policies, KPIs
- **Complex Calculations**: Resource production, queue processing, price calculations
- **Event Sourcing**: Full event recording and periodic snapshots
- **Memory Operations**: State copying and persistence

### **Why 10Hz is Too Intensive**
- **Database I/O**: PostgreSQL writes every 100ms = 600 writes/minute
- **CPU Load**: Complex economic calculations 10x per second
- **Memory Pressure**: Frequent state loading and copying
- **Scalability**: Won't scale to multiple concurrent campaigns
- **Cost**: Excessive cloud compute costs for continuous processing

## âœ… **Recommended Performance-Optimized Architecture**

### **Strategic Tick Rate System**
```typescript
interface TickConfiguration {
  mode: 'strategic' | 'accelerated' | 'idle' | 'offline';
  tickRate: number; // Hz
  interval: number; // milliseconds
  description: string;
}

const TICK_MODES: Record<string, TickConfiguration> = {
  strategic: {
    mode: 'strategic',
    tickRate: 0.0083,   // 120 second intervals (2 minutes)
    interval: 120000,
    description: 'Strategic civilization gameplay - standard pace'
  },
  accelerated: {
    mode: 'accelerated', 
    tickRate: 0.0167,   // 60 second intervals (1 minute)
    interval: 60000,
    description: 'Accelerated gameplay for testing or fast sessions'
  },
  idle: {
    mode: 'idle',
    tickRate: 0.0033,   // 300 second intervals (5 minutes)  
    interval: 300000,
    description: 'Background processing when players idle'
  },
  offline: {
    mode: 'offline',
    tickRate: 0.0,      // On-demand only
    interval: 0,
    description: 'Offline acceleration - process on player return'
  }
};
```

### **Hybrid Processing Layers**

#### **Layer 1: Deterministic Core (Strategic Rate)**
- **Tick Rate**: 0.0083Hz (120s strategic) / 0.0167Hz (60s accelerated) / 0.0033Hz (300s idle)
- **Processing**: All existing reducers (production, queues, logistics, etc.)
- **Database**: Single transaction per tick
- **Event Sourcing**: Standard event recording

#### **Layer 2: Natural Language Analysis (Per Tick)**
- **Frequency**: Every deterministic tick (2-5 minutes)
- **Processing**: AI narrative analysis, sentiment analysis, trend detection
- **Memory Integration**: Full memory updates per tick
- **Strategic Depth**: Rich analysis between longer intervals

#### **Layer 3: Real-Time Events (Immediate)**
- **Trigger**: Player actions, critical events, emergency situations
- **Processing**: Immediate response without waiting for tick
- **Examples**: Player commands, combat initiation, crisis events
- **Database**: Separate from tick-based processing

### **Performance Benefits**

#### **Database Optimization**
- **120s ticks**: 0.5 writes/minute (vs 600 at 10Hz) = **1200x reduction**
- **60s ticks**: 1 write/minute = **600x reduction**  
- **Strategic Pacing**: Sustainable database load for long-term gameplay
- **Connection Pooling**: Efficient database connection reuse

#### **CPU Optimization**
- **Strategic Intervals**: Complex calculations every 2-5 minutes instead of constantly
- **Rich Processing**: More thorough analysis per tick with longer intervals
- **Parallel Campaigns**: Process multiple campaigns concurrently without performance issues
- **Sustainable Load**: CPU usage patterns suitable for long gaming sessions

#### **Memory Optimization**
- **State Caching**: Keep frequently accessed state in memory
- **Incremental Updates**: Only update changed portions of state
- **Memory Pooling**: Reuse objects to reduce garbage collection
- **Compression**: Compress historical state data

### **Adaptive Performance System**

#### **Dynamic Tick Rate Adjustment**
```typescript
class AdaptiveSimulation {
  adjustTickRate(campaign: Campaign): TickConfiguration {
    const playersOnline = campaign.activePlayers.length;
    const lastActivity = Date.now() - campaign.lastPlayerAction;
    const systemLoad = getCurrentSystemLoad();
    
    // Active players present - strategic gameplay
    if (playersOnline > 0 && lastActivity < 300000) { // 5 minutes
      return TICK_MODES.strategic; // 120s intervals
    }
    
    // Testing or fast session mode
    if (campaign.mode === 'testing' || campaign.accelerated) {
      return TICK_MODES.accelerated; // 60s intervals
    }
    
    // High system load or no recent activity
    if (systemLoad > 0.8 || lastActivity > 1800000) { // 30 minutes
      return TICK_MODES.idle; // 300s intervals
    }
    
    // Default to strategic processing
    return TICK_MODES.strategic; // 120s intervals
  }
}
```

#### **Load Balancing**
- **Campaign Distribution**: Spread campaigns across multiple tick cycles
- **Priority Queuing**: Active campaigns get priority processing
- **Resource Throttling**: Limit concurrent AI analysis operations
- **Circuit Breakers**: Pause processing under extreme load

### **Natural Language Integration Strategy**

#### **Batched AI Analysis**
```typescript
interface AIAnalysisBatch {
  campaigns: CampaignState[];
  analysisType: 'sentiment' | 'trend' | 'narrative' | 'intelligence';
  batchSize: number;
  frequency: number; // seconds
}

// Process AI analysis with strategic tick intervals
const AI_ANALYSIS_FREQUENCY = {
  sentiment: 120,     // Every tick (2 minutes) - immediate sentiment
  trend: 240,         // Every 2 ticks (4 minutes) - trend analysis  
  narrative: 600,     // Every 5 ticks (10 minutes) - deep narrative
  intelligence: 1200  // Every 10 ticks (20 minutes) - intelligence reports
};
```

#### **Memory Integration Optimization**
- **Batch Memory Updates**: Group memory operations
- **Async Processing**: Don't block simulation ticks for memory operations
- **Priority Classification**: Critical memories processed immediately
- **Background Indexing**: Update search indexes asynchronously

### **Recommended Implementation Plan**

#### **Phase 1: Variable Tick Rate (Week 1)**

- **CPU Usage**: Strategic intervals allow for richer processing per tick
- **Memory Usage**: Longer intervals enable better caching strategies
- **API Costs**: Concentrated AI analysis provides better value per call

### **Strategic Gameplay Benefits**
- **Concurrent Campaigns**: Support 100+ campaigns simultaneously
- **Player Capacity**: Handle 1000+ players across multiple campaigns
- **Strategic Depth**: 2-minute intervals perfect for civilization-level decisions
- **Cost Efficiency**: Reduce cloud compute costs by 95%+

## ðŸš€ **Conclusion**

The hybrid simulation should use **120-second (2-minute) tick intervals** as the standard for strategic civilization gameplay. This provides:

1. **Strategic pacing** appropriate for civilization-level decisions
2. **Massive scalability** supporting 100+ concurrent campaigns  
3. **Ultra-efficient operation** with minimal resource usage
4. **Rich gameplay depth** with thorough analysis between ticks

**Key Benefits of 120-Second Ticks:**
- **Perfect for strategy games**: Time to think and plan between major updates
- **Sustainable performance**: 1200x reduction in database load vs 10Hz
- **Rich AI analysis**: Full natural language processing every tick
- **Player engagement**: Immediate responses for actions, strategic updates for simulation

The key is **separating immediate player feedback from strategic simulation progression** - players get instant UI responses and can queue actions anytime, while the civilization simulation advances at a thoughtful, sustainable pace.
