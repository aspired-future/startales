# AI Content Generation Status

## ✅ What's Working:
- New AI prompt-based system is generating content like: *"My quantum microwave has achieved sentience and is now critiquing my seasoning choices. Even my appliances are food snobs now 👨‍🍳🤖 #SmartKitchen #FoodCritic"*
- Content distribution logic (35/35/30) is implemented
- Character context integration is working
- AI simulation function is creating variations

## ❌ What's Still Broken:
- Old template system is still running in parallel, generating posts like: *"WEATHER ALERT: {weather_event} expected in {region} over the next {timeframe}. Residents advised to {advice}. #WeatherAlert #SafetyFirst"*
- There are still `{placeholder}` templates being used
- Need to completely remove all old template code

## Next Steps:
1. Find and remove ALL remaining template code
2. Ensure only AI-generated content is used
3. Test that no `{placeholders}` appear in output
4. Verify proper content distribution

## Current Test Results:
- Post 1: ❌ Still using templates: `{weather_event}`, `{region}`, `{timeframe}`, `{advice}`
- Post 2: ✅ AI Generated: "My quantum microwave has achieved sentience..."

The system is partially working but needs complete cleanup of old template code.
