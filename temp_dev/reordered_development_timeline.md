# Reordered Development Timeline: Features First, Testing Last

## ðŸŽ¯ **Logical Development Approach**

You're absolutely right! We should **implement the core functionality first**, then create comprehensive tests for the completed systems. This ensures we're testing **real, working features** rather than theoretical APIs.
