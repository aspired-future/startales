2. **Clear browser cache** and reload
3. Check browser console for any JavaScript errors
4. Verify the UI development server restarted successfully
5. Try navigating to different sections and back to WhoseApp

## üì± **Expected User Experience**

The unified interface should feel like a modern messaging app with:
- **Seamless switching** between text and voice
- **Character-appropriate responses** (formal for PM, technical for Science Advisor)
- **Game context integration** (mentions of civilization, current events)
- **Professional UI** matching the game's aesthetic
- **Real-time interaction** with immediate feedback

If any of these elements are missing or not working, let me know the specific issue!
