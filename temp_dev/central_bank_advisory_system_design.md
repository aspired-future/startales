# Central Bank Advisory System - Design Document

## üéØ Overview

The **Central Bank Advisory System** provides comprehensive monetary policy recommendations, financial stability analysis, and economic guidance while maintaining the **player-centric control model** where the leader retains final authority over all financial decisions. The Central Bank operates as an independent advisory institution that can provide expert recommendations but cannot unilaterally implement policies.
