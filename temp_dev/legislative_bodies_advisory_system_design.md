# Legislative Bodies Advisory System - Design Document

## üéØ Overview

The **Legislative Bodies Advisory System** provides comprehensive legislative oversight, law proposal development, and policy recommendations while maintaining the **player-centric control model** where the leader retains final authority over all legislative decisions. The legislative bodies operate as advisory institutions that can propose laws, debate policies, and provide democratic input, but the leader has ultimate authority to approve, modify, or disapprove all legislative proposals.

## üèõÔ∏è System Architecture

### Core Philosophy: Democratic Advisory with Leader Authority
- **Legislative Independence**: Legislative bodies maintain analytical and deliberative independence
- **Leader Authority**: The leader has final decision-making power over all laws and policies
- **Advisory Role**: Legislative bodies provide democratic input, policy analysis, and law proposals
- **Constitutional Framework**: All proposals must align with constitutional principles (advisory review)
- **Democratic Representation**: Multiple parties with diverse perspectives and ideologies

## üìä System Components

### 1. Legislative Proposal System

- **Defense Committee**: Military policy, security legislation, defense spending
- **Foreign Relations Committee**: International treaties, diplomatic policy, trade agreements
- **Judiciary Committee**: Legal system oversight, judicial appointments, law enforcement
- **Commerce Committee**: Business regulation, trade policy, economic development
- **Science & Technology Committee**: Research funding, innovation policy, technology regulation

- **Amendment Authority**: Leader can request specific amendments to proposals
- **Implementation Oversight**: Leader controls implementation of approved legislation
