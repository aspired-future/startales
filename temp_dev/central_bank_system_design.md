# Central Bank System Design (Advisory Model)

## Overview
Design and implement a comprehensive Central Bank system that provides expert monetary policy recommendations to the leader. The Central Bank operates as an advisory body with varying degrees of influence, but the leader retains final authority over all monetary and financial decisions.

## Core Components

### 1. Central Bank Advisory Structure

```typescript
interface CentralBank {
  id: string;
  civilizationId: string;
  name: string;
  establishedDate: Date;
  advisoryRole: {
    level: 'full_advisory' | 'limited_advisory' | 'ceremonial';
    recommendationWeight: number; // 0-100 influence on leader decisions
    appointmentProcess: 'independent' | 'executive' | 'legislative';
    termLengths: number; // years
    publicCredibility: number; // affects market confidence
    expertiseAreas: string[]; // monetary policy, banking, international finance
  };
  leadership: {
    governor: CentralBankGovernor;
    deputyGovernors: CentralBankGovernor[];
    boardMembers: BoardMember[];
    votingStructure: 'consensus' | 'majority' | 'governor_authority';
  };
  mandate: {
    primaryObjectives: ('price_stability' | 'full_employment' | 'financial_stability')[];
    inflationTarget: number; // percentage
    employmentTarget?: number; // percentage
    exchangeRateTarget?: number;
  };
}
```

### 2. Monetary Policy Recommendations

```typescript
interface MonetaryPolicyRecommendation {
  id: string;
  centralBankId: string;
  timestamp: Date;
  type: 'interest_rate' | 'quantitative_easing' | 'emergency_action' | 'currency_intervention';
  urgency: 'routine' | 'important' | 'urgent' | 'crisis';
  
  recommendations: {
    interestRates?: {
      baseRate: number;
      discountRate: number;
      reserveRate: number;
      rationale: string;
      expectedImpact: string;
    };
    quantitativeEasing?: {
      assetPurchases: number;
      duration: number; // months
      targetAssets: string[];
      rationale: string;
      riskAssessment: string;
    };
    currencyIntervention?: {
      action: 'buy' | 'sell' | 'stabilize';
      amount: number;
      targetRate: number;
      rationale: string;
      marketImpact: string;
    };
    emergencyMeasures?: {
      bailoutRecommendations: BailoutRecommendation[];
      liquiditySupport: LiquidityRecommendation[];
      marketStabilization: MarketStabilizationRecommendation[];
    };
  };

    currentEconomicConditions: string;
    riskFactors: string[];
    alternativeOptions: string[];
    internationalConsiderations: string;

  };
  
  leaderResponse?: {
    decision: 'approved' | 'modified' | 'rejected' | 'deferred';
    modifications?: string;
    rationale?: string;
    implementationDate?: Date;
  };
}
```

### 3. Leader Decision Interface

```typescript
interface LeaderMonetaryDecision {
  id: string;
  recommendationId?: string; // if based on central bank recommendation
  leaderId: string;
  timestamp: Date;
  
  decision: {
    type: 'interest_rate' | 'quantitative_easing' | 'emergency_action' | 'currency_intervention';
    parameters: Record<string, any>;
    rationale: string;
    overrideReason?: string; // if going against central bank advice
  };
  
  implementation: {
    effectiveDate: Date;
    phaseIn?: boolean;
    duration?: number;
    reviewDate?: Date;
  };
  
  consequences: {
    marketReaction: number; // -100 to 100
    publicConfidence: number; // -100 to 100
    internationalReaction: number; // -100 to 100
    economicImpact: EconomicImpactProjection;
  };
}
```
