# Inter-Civilization Diplomatic Synchronization System

## Overview
This system ensures that when State Departments of different civilizations communicate, they receive the same core factual information while maintaining their own unique perspectives, analysis, and strategic interpretations. This prevents information fabrication and creates authentic diplomatic interactions.

## üîÑ **Core Synchronization Principle**

### **Single Source of Truth**
When Civilization A sends a message to Civilization B:
1. **Core Content** is identical for both parties (facts, proposals, terms)
2. **Sender Perspective** reflects Civilization A's viewpoint and analysis
3. **Receiver Perspective** is automatically generated based on Civilization B's characteristics
4. **Both civilizations** get complete records in their diplomatic communications

### **Information Consistency**
- ‚úÖ **Same Facts**: Both civs see identical factual content, proposed terms, deadlines
- ‚úÖ **Different Analysis**: Each civ gets analysis tailored to their culture, government, and strategic situation
- ‚úÖ **Authentic Perspectives**: AI-generated viewpoints based on civilization profiles and relationships
- ‚úÖ **No Fabrication**: Core information cannot be altered or misrepresented

## üèóÔ∏è **System Architecture**

### **1. Synchronized Message Structure**
```typescript
interface DiplomaticMessage {
  id: string;
  messageType: 'treaty_proposal' | 'trade_offer' | 'alliance_request' | 'diplomatic_note' | 'protest' | 'invitation' | 'response';
  senderCivilizationId: string;
  receiverCivilizationId: string;
  
  // IDENTICAL FOR BOTH CIVILIZATIONS
  coreContent: {
    subject: string;
    factualContent: string;        // Objective facts both sides see
    proposedTerms?: Record<string, any>;
    requestedAction?: string;
    deadline?: Date;
    urgency: 'routine' | 'normal' | 'urgent' | 'immediate';
    classification: 'public' | 'diplomatic' | 'confidential' | 'secret';
  };
  
  // CIVILIZATION-SPECIFIC PERSPECTIVES
  senderPerspective: CivilizationPerspective;
  receiverPerspective: CivilizationPerspective;
  
  status: 'sent' | 'received' | 'acknowledged' | 'responded';
  attachments: MessageAttachment[];
}
```

### **2. Civilization-Specific Perspective**
```typescript
interface CivilizationPerspective {
  civilizationId: string;
  interpretation: string;           // How this civ interprets the message
  analysis: string;                // Strategic analysis from their viewpoint
  recommendedResponse?: string;     // Suggested response options
  internalNotes: string;           // Private notes not shared with other civ
  culturalContext: string;         // Cultural framework interpretation
  strategicImplications: string;   // Strategic meaning for this civ
  riskAssessment: {
    level: 'low' | 'medium' | 'high' | 'critical';
    factors: string[];
    mitigation: string[];
  };
}
```

### **3. Message Attachments**
```typescript
interface MessageAttachment {
  id: string;
  type: 'treaty_draft' | 'trade_agreement' | 'map' | 'technical_specs' | 'cultural_exchange' | 'other';
  filename: string;
  coreData: Record<string, any>;   // IDENTICAL data both sides see
  senderAnnotations?: string;      // Sender's notes on the attachment
  receiverAnnotations?: string;    // Receiver's notes on the attachment
}
```

## üîß **Implementation Details**

### **Database Schema**
```sql
-- Synchronized messages table
CREATE TABLE synchronized_diplomatic_messages (
  id VARCHAR(255) PRIMARY KEY,
  message_type VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,
  sender_civilization_id VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
  receiver_civilization_id VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
  core_content JSONB NOT NULL DEFAULT '{}',           -- Same for both civs
  sender_perspective JSONB NOT NULL DEFAULT '{}',     -- Sender's viewpoint
  receiver_perspective JSONB DEFAULT '{}',            -- Receiver's viewpoint
  status VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL DEFAULT 'sent',
  timestamp TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
  response_deadline TIMESTAMP,
  linked_message_id VARCHAR(255),                     -- For responses
  attachments JSONB DEFAULT '[]',
  created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
  updated_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
);
```

### **Service Layer Integration**
The `DiplomaticSynchronizationService` handles:
- **Message Creation**: Stores single synchronized record
- **Perspective Generation**: AI-powered analysis for receiving civilization
- **Dual Communication Records**: Creates diplomatic communications for both civs
- **Response Handling**: Links responses to original messages
- **Consistency Enforcement**: Ensures core content remains identical

## üéØ **Key Features**

### **1. Automatic Perspective Generation**
When a message is sent, the system automatically generates the receiver's perspective based on:
- **Civilization Profile**: Culture, government type, economic system, strategic priorities
- **Current Relationship**: Trust level, cooperation metrics, historical context
- **Message Content**: Type, urgency, proposed terms, strategic implications
- **Risk Assessment**: Threat analysis, mitigation strategies, decision factors

### **2. Bidirectional Communication Records**
Each synchronized message creates **two diplomatic communication records**:

#### **Sender's Record:**
```
DIPLOMATIC COMMUNICATION - SENT

TO: Stellar Federation
SUBJECT: Treaty Proposal - Trade Agreement
CLASSIFICATION: CONFIDENTIAL

CORE MESSAGE:
We propose a comprehensive trade agreement that would reduce tariffs by 25% on manufactured goods and establish preferential trading status for both civilizations.

PROPOSED TERMS:
{
  "tariff_reduction": 25,
  "goods_categories": ["manufactured", "technology", "luxury"],
  "duration_years": 10,
  "review_period": 2
}

OUR PERSPECTIVE:
Interpretation: We are proposing a trade treaty that we believe will be mutually beneficial.
Strategic Analysis: This treaty aligns with our strategic objectives and should provide significant advantages to both parties.

Strategic Implications: Successful treaty could significantly enhance our regional position.
Risk Assessment: MEDIUM - Potential rejection, counter-proposals may be unfavorable
```

#### **Receiver's Record:**
```
