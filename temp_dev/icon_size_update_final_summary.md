## ✅ **Successfully Made Icons Even Bigger and Text Larger**

I've significantly increased both the icon sizes and label text sizes in the navigation grid to make them much more prominent and readable.

### **🔧 Changes Made:**

**File:** `src/ui_frontend/components/GameHUD/ComprehensiveHUD.css`

#### **Icon Size Increase:**
**CSS Class:** `.btn-icon`
- **Previous:** `font-size: 32px` (from first update)
- **New:** `font-size: 48px`
- **Total Increase:** 140% larger than original (20px → 48px)

#### **Label Text Size Increase:**
**CSS Class:** `.btn-label`
- **Previous:** `font-size: 10px`
- **New:** `font-size: 14px`

### **📱 Updated Navigation Icons:**

All six main navigation icons are now much larger:

- **🌌 Galaxy** - 48px icons with 14px labels
- **🏛️ Civ** - 48px icons with 14px labels

### **✨ Visual Impact:**

**Before (Original):**
- 20px icons with 10px labels
- Icons looked small in their 70px boxes
- Text was hard to read

**After (Final Update):**
- 48px icons with 14px labels
- Icons now properly fill their containers
- Text is much more readable and prominent
- Professional, polished appearance

### **🎯 Benefits Achieved:**

1. **Dramatic Visual Improvement:**
   - Icons are now 2.4x larger than original
   - Much better visual hierarchy and prominence
   - Icons properly fill their allocated space

2. **Enhanced Readability:**
   - Labels are 40% larger and much easier to read
   - Better accessibility for all users
   - More professional appearance

3. **Better User Experience:**
   - Icons are now the clear focal point of each button
   - Easier to identify different sections at a glance
   - More intuitive navigation experience

### **📊 Size Progression:**

```
Original:  20px icons, 10px labels
Update 1:  32px icons, 10px labels  (+60% icons)
Update 2:  48px icons, 14px labels  (+140% icons, +40% labels)
```

### **🔍 Regarding the 88% Element:**

I searched extensively for the floating 88% element but couldn't locate it in the current codebase. It may be:
- A temporary overlay that appears under specific conditions
- Part of a modal or popup that wasn't active during the search
- Generated dynamically by JavaScript
- From a different component or screen

**Recommendation:** If the 88% element appears again, please let me know which screen/component it's on, and I can locate and remove it specifically.

## 🎉 **UPDATE COMPLETE**

The navigation icons are now **significantly larger and more prominent** with much better text readability. The interface should look much more professional and be easier to use! 🚀

**Final Result:**
- ✅ Icons increased from 20px → 48px (140% larger)
- ✅ Labels increased from 10px → 14px (40% larger)
- ✅ Much better visual hierarchy and usability
