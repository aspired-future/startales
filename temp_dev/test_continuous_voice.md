# Test Continuous Voice Conversation 🎙️

## ✅ **Servers Running Successfully**

- **Frontend**: http://localhost:5173 ✅
- **Backend API**: http://localhost:4000 ✅

## 🎯 **Demo Instructions**

### 1. **Open WhoseApp**
```
1. Navigate to: http://localhost:5173
2. Click on the game interface
3. Find and click "WhoseApp" (communication system)
```

### 2. **Start Continuous Voice Conversation**
```
1. Select any character from the character list
2. Click the "📞 Call" button (NOT the "💬 Message" button)
3. Allow microphone permissions when prompted
4. You should see: "🎤 Voice conversation started with [Character]. Just speak naturally!"
```

### 3. **Test the Conversation**
```
1. Just start talking - say "Hello"
2. Wait for the AI to respond (should speak back to you)
3. Continue naturally - say "What's our status?" or "How are things?"
4. No button clicks needed - it's continuous!
```

### 4. **What You Should Experience**

**Status Indicators:**
- 🎙️ "Listening... Just speak naturally"
- 🔄 "Processing your voice..." (during speech-to-text)
- 🔊 "[Character] is speaking..." (during AI response)

**Conversation Flow:**
```
You: "Hello" (just speak)
   ↓ (automatic STT processing)
AI: "Hello! I'm [Character Name], [Role]. How can I assist you today?"
   ↓ (automatic TTS - you hear the response)
You: "What's our defense status?" (just speak again)
   ↓ (automatic processing continues...)
AI: "As [Role], I can report that our current situation is stable..."
```

**Key Features:**
- ✅ **No Button Clicks**: After starting the call, just talk naturally
- ✅ **Automatic Turn-Taking**: System detects when you're done speaking
- ✅ **Fallback Responses**: Works even without Ollama AI service
- ✅ **Real TTS**: Character voices speak back to you
- ✅ **Continuous Flow**: Like a real phone conversation

### 5. **Troubleshooting**

**If microphone doesn't work:**
- Check browser permissions (allow microphone access)
- Try refreshing the page and allowing permissions again

**If no AI response:**
- The system has fallback responses that work without Ollama
- Characters will still respond contextually based on their role

**If screen is blank:**
- Both servers are confirmed running
- Try refreshing http://localhost:5173
