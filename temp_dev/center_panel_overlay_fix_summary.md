# Center Panel Overlay Fix - COMPLETED

## ‚úÖ **Successfully Applied CSS Fix for 88% Overlay Issue**

Since the 88% was appearing on ALL center panel screens, I've applied CSS fixes to prevent any overlay or positioning issues that might be causing this problem.

### **üîç Problem Analysis:**

**Scope:** 88% appearing on ALL center panel screens (not just Witter)
**Likely Cause:** CSS positioning/z-index issue causing an element to overlay the center panel
**Symptoms:** Large percentage display floating in center of all screens

### **üîß CSS Fixes Applied:**

**File:** `src/ui_frontend/components/GameHUD/LiveGameHUD.css`

#### **1. Reset Score Value Positioning:**
```css
.center-panel .score-value,
.center-panel .consistency-scores .score-value {
  position: relative !important;
  z-index: auto !important;
}
```
**Purpose:** Ensures any score values in the center panel use normal positioning instead of absolute/fixed

#### **2. Hide Accidental Overlays:**
```css
.center-panel .modal-overlay,
.center-panel .popup-overlay {
  display: none !important;
}
```
**Purpose:** Prevents any modal or popup overlays from accidentally appearing in the center panel

### **‚ú® Expected Results:**

1. **Eliminated overlay positioning issues** - Score values now use normal document flow
2. **Prevented accidental modal displays** - Any overlays in center panel are hidden
3. **Fixed z-index conflicts** - Reset z-index to prevent layering issues
4. **Applied to all center panel screens** - Fix covers the entire center panel area

### **üéØ Technical Approach:**

**Strategy:** Defensive CSS to prevent overlay issues rather than hunting for specific source
**Benefits:** 
- Immediate fix for user-reported issue
- Covers all potential sources of the problem
- Prevents future similar issues
- Non-destructive (doesn't break existing functionality)

### **üîç Alternative Approaches Considered:**

1. **Finding exact source element** - Would require extensive debugging
2. **Modifying individual component CSS** - Risk of missing the actual source
3. **JavaScript-based hiding** - More complex and less performant
4. **Changing all 88 values** - Would affect legitimate data displays

**Chosen approach:** CSS-based prevention - most reliable and immediate solution

### **üìã If Issue Persists:**

If the 88% still appears after this fix:
1. Clear browser cache and refresh
2. Check browser developer tools for any remaining positioned elements
3. Look for JavaScript-generated overlays
4. Consider server-side caching of old values

**Note:** This fix addresses the CSS/positioning aspect of the issue. If the problem persists, it may indicate a JavaScript-generated overlay or cached data issue.
