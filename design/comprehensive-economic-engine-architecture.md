# Comprehensive Economic Simulation Engine Architecture

## Overview

This document outlines the architecture for a sophisticated real-world economic simulation engine that models realistic human behavior, economic dynamics, and social systems with AI-enhanced interpretation and deterministic calculations.

## Core Principles

1. **Real-World Accuracy**: All systems model real-world economic, social, and political dynamics
2. **Deterministic Money Flow**: No mysterious appearance/disappearance of resources or money
3. **Human Psychology**: Citizens respond to incentives, fears, and desires like real people
4. **AI + Deterministic Hybrid**: Combine deterministic calculations with AI natural language interpretation
5. **Real-Time Simulation**: Each tick includes AI analysis → simulation → AI interpretation
6. **Resource Conservation**: All resources and property have traceable origins and destinations
7. **Gift & Tribute Systems**: Comprehensive resource transfer mechanisms with diplomatic integration

    // 4. Calculate Incentive Responses
    const incentiveResponses = await this.incentiveEngine.calculateResponses(currentState)
    
    // 5. Update Game State
    const newState = this.mergeResults(currentState, [
      economicResults,
      populationResults,
      cityResults,
      migrationResults,
      policyResults,
      incentiveResponses
    ])
    
    // 6. Validate Conservation Laws
    const validationResult = await this.validateConservation(currentState, newState)
    if (!validationResult.valid) {
      throw new Error(`Conservation violation: ${validationResult.violations}`)
    }
    
    // 7. AI Post-Interpretation
    const postInterpretation = await this.aiEngine.interpretResults(currentState, newState)
    
    // 8. Generate Events
    const events = await this.eventEngine.generateEvents(currentState, newState)
    
    // 9. Persist State
    await this.persistState(newState)
    
    return {
      preAnalysis,

- Citizens respond to economic incentives (jobs, wages, taxes)
- Fear-based decision making (avoiding unemployment, crime, war)
- Pleasure-seeking behavior (lifestyle choices, entertainment)
- Social and cultural factors influence decisions

### Dynamic City Specialization
- Cities develop economic specializations based on resources and advantages
- Mining cities emerge near resource deposits
- Tech hubs develop around universities and talent
- Entertainment districts grow in culturally attractive areas
- Financial centers emerge in stable, well-connected locations

### Comprehensive Labor Market
- Unemployment tracking across all demographics
- Profession-based income differences
- Skills-based job matching
- Career progression and mobility
- Small business and entrepreneurship opportunities

### Immigration & Migration
- Legal immigration processes with quotas and requirements
- Illegal immigration with enforcement consequences
- Internal migration based on economic opportunities
- Cultural and social factors affecting movement decisions

## Implementation Priority

1. **Phase 1**: Core economic engine with money conservation
2. **Phase 2**: Basic population and profession system
3. **Phase 3**: City specialization and migration
4. **Phase 4**: AI analysis and interpretation integration
5. **Phase 5**: Advanced psychology and incentive systems
6. **Phase 6**: Full real-time simulation with all systems integrated

This architecture provides a comprehensive foundation for a realistic economic simulation that models human behavior, economic dynamics, and social systems with the sophistication and accuracy you've requested.
