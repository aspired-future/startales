# Game Modes Architecture â€” Startales

## Overview

Startales supports four distinct game modes that provide different player experiences while sharing the same core simulation engine and infrastructure. Each mode has unique victory conditions, player interactions, and AI behaviors while maintaining the real-time voice-driven gameplay foundation.

## Core Game Modes

### 1. COOP Mode: Galactic Defense Alliance

#### **Objective & Victory Conditions**
- **Primary Goal**: Defend the galaxy against external threats from other dimensions/galaxies
- **Victory Conditions**: 
  - Successfully repel all major threat waves (3-5 escalating invasions)
  - Achieve collective prosperity threshold (combined empire strength > threat level)
  - Establish galactic peace treaty with remaining neutral factions
  - Maintain alliance cohesion (no player eliminations due to internal conflict)

#### **Threat System**
- **Threat Types**:
  - **Dimensional Invaders**: Powerful extra-galactic empires with advanced technology
  - **Cosmic Disasters**: Galaxy-wide events (supernovas, black hole storms, reality tears)
  - **Rogue AI Networks**: Self-replicating AI systems that consume civilizations
  - **Ancient Awakened**: Dormant precursor races that view current civilizations as pests
  - **Interdimensional Parasites**: Entities that feed on psychic energy and technological advancement

- **Threat Scaling**: 
  - Threat intensity = f(combined_player_strength, coordination_effectiveness, time_elapsed)
  - Adaptive AI that responds to player strategies and alliance formations
  - Multiple simultaneous threats require resource allocation decisions

#### **Cooperative Mechanics**
- **Shared Resource Pools**: Optional resource sharing agreements between allied empires
- **Joint Military Operations**: Combined fleet actions with shared command structure
- **Research Collaboration**: Shared technology trees and accelerated research through cooperation

### 2. Achievement Mode: Galactic Supremacy Points

#### **Objective & Victory Conditions**
- **Primary Goal**: Accumulate the most achievement points across multiple categories
- **Victory Conditions**:
  - Highest total points at campaign end (time-based or turn-based)
  - First to reach predetermined point threshold (e.g., 10,000 points)
  - Maintain point lead for consecutive periods (momentum victory)

#### **Scoring Categories**
- **Military Conquest** (25% weight): Territory controlled, battles won, enemy units destroyed
- **Economic Dominance** (20% weight): Trade volume, resource production, market control
- **Technological Advancement** (20% weight): Research completed, innovations discovered, tech level
- **Diplomatic Influence** (15% weight): Alliances formed, treaties negotiated, faction reputation

## Integration with Existing Systems

### Sprint Integration

The game mode system integrates with the existing sprint structure:

- **Sprint 1-4**: Foundation systems support all game modes
- **Sprint 5**: Population system affects all modes differently (COOP: collective population, Achievement: population growth points, Conquest: population control, Hero: NPC interactions)
- **Sprint 12**: Alliance system is core to COOP mode, optional in others
- **New Sprint**: Game Mode Implementation Sprint (detailed below)

### Demo Integration

Each existing demo can be extended to showcase different game modes:
- **HUD Demo**: Mode-specific UI elements and victory condition tracking
- **Policy Demo**: Mode-specific policy effects (COOP: alliance policies, Achievement: point-optimized policies, etc.)
- **Trade Demo**: Mode-specific trade mechanics (COOP: resource sharing, Conquest: trade route control, etc.)

## Next Steps

1. **Update Sprint Planning**: Add Game Mode Implementation Sprint
2. **Extend Existing Demos**: Add mode selection and mode-specific features
3. **Database Migration**: Add game mode tables and relationships
4. **API Implementation**: Build mode-specific endpoints and logic
5. **UI Components**: Create mode selection and mode-specific UI elements
6. **Testing Strategy**: Develop comprehensive tests for each game mode
7. **Documentation**: Create player guides for each game mode
