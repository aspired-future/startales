Player: "We come in peace, seeking trade and cooperation"

```

**Negotiating with Mechanoid Hegemony:**
```
Player: "Propose a technology sharing agreement"

Player: "Agreed, but we need guarantees about data security"
AI: "Security protocols acknowledged. Implementing encryption standard Omega-7. Data compartmentalization: Complete. Trust verification: Your species demonstrates acceptable logical reasoning. Agreement parameters are... satisfactory."
```

**Dealing with Minor Character - Planetary Governor:**
```
Player: "What's the status of the Mars colony?"
Governor Chen: "Admiral, excellent timing! Production is up 23% this quarter, and we've discovered rare earth deposits in the southern hemisphere. However, we're seeing increased pirate activity in the outer system. I'd like to request additional patrol ships and funding for a new defense grid."

Player: "Approved. What about population growth?"
Governor Chen: "Thank you, sir! Population is steady at 2.3 million, with immigration applications up 40%. We're becoming quite the destination. Oh, and the university wants to establish a xenobiology research center - apparently they're excited about some samples from the Vega expedition."
