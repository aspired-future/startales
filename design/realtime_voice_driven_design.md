# Startales: Real-Time Voice-Driven Galactic Strategy
## Living Universe with Continuous Progression

### üéØ **Core Design Philosophy**

**REAL-TIME EVERYTHING:**
- No turns, no waiting - the universe is always alive and evolving
- Players can jump in/out at any time and things keep happening
- Voice commands execute immediately with real-time feedback
- Battles, diplomacy, research, construction all happen simultaneously

**VOICE-FIRST INTERFACE:**
- Primary interaction through natural speech
- "Build a space station at Kepler-442b"
- "Send the 3rd Fleet to defend Alpha Centauri"
- "Research psychic amplification technology"
- "Negotiate a trade agreement with the Zephyrian Empire"

**CONSTANT PROGRESSION:**
- Characters gain XP and level up continuously
- Civilizations advance through tech trees in real-time
- Territories develop and grow autonomously
- Players always see measurable progress
