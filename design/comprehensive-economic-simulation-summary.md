# Comprehensive Economic Simulation - Implementation Plan

## Vision Summary

You've requested a sophisticated real-world economic simulation that models realistic human behavior, economic dynamics, and social systems. The key requirements are:

### Core Principles
1. **Real-World Accuracy**: All systems model actual economic, social, and political dynamics
2. **Deterministic Money Flow**: No mysterious appearance/disappearance of resources or money  
3. **Human Psychology**: Citizens respond to incentives, fears, and desires like real people
4. **AI + Deterministic Hybrid**: Combine deterministic calculations with AI natural language interpretation
5. **Real-Time Simulation**: Each tick includes AI analysis â†’ simulation â†’ AI interpretation
6. **Resource Conservation**: All resources and property have traceable origins and destinations

### Key Features Requested
- **Citizens & Demographics**: Individual citizens with psychological profiles, education, professions, income
- **Incentive Responses**: Job opportunities, business opportunities, entrepreneurship, taxes/tax incentives, grants
- **Small Businesses**: Comprehensive small business ecosystem with financial tracking
- **Unemployment Tracking**: Overall and across industries/education levels/demographics
- **Profession Differentiation**: Different professions earn different amounts realistically
- **Human Psychology**: Fear of pain, war, imprisonment; seeking pleasure/enjoyment
- **Immigration**: Legal and illegal immigration with realistic movement patterns
- **City Specialization**: Cities specialize in mining, entertainment, entrepreneurship, etc.
- **Migration Patterns**: People move for jobs, culture, education, quality of life

## Architecture Overview

The system is built around several interconnected engines:

### 1. Core Simulation Engine
- Orchestrates all sub-systems
- Maintains deterministic behavior with seeded RNG
- Ensures resource conservation laws
- Integrates AI analysis with deterministic calculations

### 2. Economic Engine
- Tracks all money flows with strict conservation
- Models supply/demand, inflation, interest rates
- Maintains balance sheets for all entities
- Provides audit trails for all transactions

### 3. Population Engine
- Individual citizen modeling with psychological profiles
- Career progression and skill development
- Response to incentives and life events
- Realistic demographic evolution

### 4. City & Geography Engine
- City specialization based on advantages and resources
- Infrastructure development and transport links
- Quality of life factors affecting migration
- Inter-city economic relationships

### 5. AI Analysis Engine
- Pre-simulation situation analysis
- Post-simulation result interpretation
- Natural language narrative generation
- Policy impact analysis and suggestions
