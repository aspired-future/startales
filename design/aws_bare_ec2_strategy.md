# AWS Bare EC2 Strategy for Ollama Deployment

## Executive Summary

**Bare EC2 instances provide 60-80% cost savings** over managed services for predictable AI workloads like Ollama. This strategy maximizes performance while minimizing costs through Reserved Instances, Spot Instances, and optimized instance selection.

## Cost Comparison: Bare EC2 vs Managed Services

### Monthly Costs for Equivalent GPU Performance

| Service | Configuration | On-Demand | Reserved (1yr) | Spot | Management |
|---------|---------------|-----------|----------------|------|------------|
| **EC2 g4dn.xlarge** | 4 vCPU, 16GB, T4 GPU | $379 | $227 (40% off) | $114 (70% off) | Self-managed |
| **ECS Fargate** | 4 vCPU, 16GB + GPU | $850+ | N/A | N/A | AWS-managed |
| **EKS** | Control plane + nodes | $650+ | $390+ | $195+ | Semi-managed |
| **SageMaker** | ml.g4dn.xlarge | $1,200+ | N/A | N/A | Fully-managed |

### **Recommended Strategy: 70% Reserved + 30% Spot**
- **Base capacity**: Reserved Instances for guaranteed availability
- **Burst capacity**: Spot Instances for cost optimization
- **Total savings**: 50-60% vs on-demand, 70-85% vs managed services

## Optimal Instance Selection

### **Primary Instances (Ollama Hosting)**

| Instance Type | vCPU | RAM | GPU | Storage | Cost/Month | Best For |
|---------------|------|-----|-----|---------|------------|----------|
| **g4dn.xlarge** | 4 | 16GB | T4 (16GB) | 125GB NVMe | $227 (reserved) | llama3.1:8b |
| **g4dn.2xlarge** | 8 | 32GB | T4 (16GB) | 225GB NVMe | $454 (reserved) | llama3.1:70b |
| **g5.xlarge** | 4 | 16GB | A10G (24GB) | 250GB NVMe | $433 (reserved) | Latest models |

### **Support Instances (Load Balancing, Monitoring)**

| Instance Type | vCPU | RAM | Cost/Month | Purpose |
|---------------|------|-----|------------|---------|
| **t3.medium** | 2 | 4GB | $30 (reserved) | Load balancer, monitoring |
| **t3.large** | 2 | 8GB | $60 (reserved) | Database, Redis cache |

## Architecture Design

### **Multi-AZ Deployment for High Availability**

```
Region: us-east-1
├── AZ-1a (Primary)
│   ├── g4dn.xlarge (Reserved) - Ollama llama3.1:8b
│   ├── g4dn.2xlarge (Reserved) - Ollama llama3.1:70b
│   └── t3.medium (Reserved) - Load Balancer
├── AZ-1b (Secondary)
│   ├── g4dn.xlarge (Spot) - Ollama llama3.1:8b
│   └── g4dn.2xlarge (Spot) - Ollama llama3.1:70b
└── AZ-1c (Burst)
    └── g4dn.xlarge (Spot) - Auto-scaling
```

### **Auto-Scaling Strategy**

1. **Base Capacity (Reserved Instances)**
   - 2x g4dn.xlarge (always running)
   - 1x g4dn.2xlarge (always running)
   - Handles 80% of typical load

2. **Burst Capacity (Spot Instances)**
   - Auto-scaling group with 0-5 instances
   - Triggers on queue depth > 10 requests
   - 70% cost savings vs on-demand

3. **Failover Strategy**
   - Spot instance interruption → Auto-launch on-demand
   - AZ failure → Route traffic to healthy AZs
   - Instance failure → Health check triggers replacement

## Cost Optimization Techniques

### **1. Reserved Instance Strategy (40-70% savings)**

```bash
# 1-Year Reserved Instances (40% savings)
aws ec2 purchase-reserved-instances-offering \
  --reserved-instances-offering-id <offering-id> \
  --instance-count 2 \
  --instance-type g4dn.xlarge

# 3-Year Reserved Instances (60% savings)  
aws ec2 purchase-reserved-instances-offering \
  --reserved-instances-offering-id <offering-id> \
  --instance-count 1 \
  --instance-type g4dn.2xlarge
```

### **2. Spot Instance Integration (70% savings)**

```yaml
# Auto Scaling Group with Spot Instances
AutoScalingGroup:
  MixedInstancesPolicy:
    InstancesDistribution:
      OnDemandPercentage: 30
      SpotAllocationStrategy: diversified
    LaunchTemplate:
      Overrides:
        - InstanceType: g4dn.xlarge
          SpotPrice: "0.20"  # 70% off on-demand
        - InstanceType: g4dn.2xlarge  
          SpotPrice: "0.40"  # 70% off on-demand
```

### **3. Storage Optimization**

- **Instance Store**: Use built-in NVMe for model storage (free)
- **EBS GP3**: Only for persistent data (logs, configs)
- **S3**: Model artifacts and backups ($0.023/GB/month)

### **4. Network Optimization**

- **VPC Endpoints**: Avoid NAT Gateway costs ($45/month)
- **CloudFront**: Cache static assets, reduce data transfer
- **Regional Deployment**: Single region to minimize cross-AZ costs

## Implementation Plan

### **Phase 1: Foundation (Month 1)**

1. **Purchase Reserved Instances**
   ```bash
   # Base capacity - always running
   2x g4dn.xlarge (1-year reserved) = $454/month
   1x g4dn.2xlarge (1-year reserved) = $454/month
   1x t3.medium (load balancer) = $30/month
   Total: $938/month base cost
   ```

2. **Deploy Infrastructure**
   ```bash
   # Launch instances with optimized AMI
   aws ec2 run-instances \
     --image-id ami-0abcdef1234567890 \  # Custom Ollama AMI
     --instance-type g4dn.xlarge \
     --key-name startales-key \
     --security-group-ids sg-12345678 \
     --subnet-id subnet-12345678 \
     --user-data file://ollama-startup.sh
   ```

3. **Configure Auto-Scaling**
   - CloudWatch metrics for queue depth
   - Auto-scaling policies for spot instances
   - Health checks and automatic replacement

### **Phase 2: Optimization (Month 2)**

   - Add spot instances to auto-scaling group
   - Test interruption handling
   - Optimize bid prices based on usage patterns

2. **Performance Tuning**
   - Model caching strategies
   - Request batching and queuing
   - GPU utilization optimization

### **Phase 3: Advanced Features (Month 3+)**

   - Model switching without instance restart
   - Intelligent request routing

2. **Cost Monitoring**
   - Real-time cost tracking
   - Budget alerts and automatic scaling limits
   - Usage-based billing integration

## Monitoring & Alerting

### **Key Metrics**

```yaml

  - CostPerRequest (target: <$0.02)
```

### **Automated Responses**

```yaml
Scaling Policies:
  ScaleUp:
    Trigger: QueueDepth > 10 for 2 minutes
    Action: Launch 1-2 spot instances
  ScaleDown:
    Trigger: QueueDepth < 2 for 10 minutes  
    Action: Terminate oldest spot instance
  Emergency:
    Trigger: ErrorRate > 10%
    Action: Launch on-demand backup instances
```

## Security & Compliance

- TLS 1.3 for all communications
- IAM roles with minimal permissions
- VPC Flow Logs for network monitoring

### **Compliance**
- SOC 2 Type II compliance through AWS
- GDPR compliance for EU users
- Regular security audits and penetration testing
