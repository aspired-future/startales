# Vector Memory & AI Context System - Product Requirements Document

## Executive Summary

Implement a vector-based memory system to enable AI-powered natural language understanding, semantic search, and contextual conversation management across the Startales gaming platform. This system will provide persistent memory of player interactions, game decisions, and strategic patterns to create more intelligent and personalized AI responses.

## Business Objectives

### Primary Goals
- **Enhanced Player Experience**: AI remembers previous conversations and adapts responses based on player history
- **Intelligent Recommendations**: Provide contextual suggestions based on similar past scenarios
- **Persistent Game Memory**: Maintain conversation context across sessions and campaigns
- **Scalable AI Architecture**: Foundation for advanced AI features like personalized tutoring and strategy analysis

### Success Metrics
- Semantic search retrieval accuracy > 85%
- Conversation context retention across sessions
- AI response relevance improvement (measured via player feedback)
- Memory system performance under concurrent load

## Technical Architecture

### Core Components

1. **Vector Database Integration (Qdrant)**
   - Leverage existing Qdrant service in docker-compose.yml
   - Store conversation embeddings with metadata
   - Support for similarity search and filtering

2. **Embedding Service**
   - Text-to-vector conversion using local or cloud models
   - Support multiple embedding providers (Ollama local, OpenAI remote)
   - Batch processing for historical data migration

3. **Conversation Storage Layer**
   - Capture all player-AI interactions
   - Store with rich metadata (campaign context, game state, entities)
   - Integrate with existing event sourcing system

4. **Memory Retrieval Engine**
   - Semantic search API for similar conversations
   - Context-aware filtering (campaign, time, player)
   - Real-time retrieval during AI response generation

5. **AI Context Integration**
   - Enhance existing LLM providers with memory context
   - Conversation history injection for better responses
   - Pattern recognition for player preferences

- Extract entities (resources, planets, strategies) from conversations
- Associate with current game state and campaign context
- Real-time embedding generation and storage

### FR004: Memory-Enhanced AI Responses
- Inject relevant conversation history into LLM prompts
- Provide context about player preferences and past decisions
- Reference similar scenarios from previous campaigns
- Maintain conversation continuity across sessions

### FR005: Memory Management Interface
- Admin dashboard for viewing conversation history
- Memory cleanup and retention policies
- Performance monitoring and analytics
- Manual memory curation and tagging

## Technical Specifications

### Data Models

```typescript
interface ConversationMemory {
  id: string;
  campaignId: number;
  playerId?: string;
  timestamp: Date;
  role: 'user' | 'assistant' | 'system';
  content: string;
  embedding: number[];
  metadata: {
    entities: string[];
    gameState?: any;
    actionType?: string;
    confidence: number;
  };
}

interface MemoryQuery {
  text?: string;
  campaignId?: number;
  timeframe?: { start: Date; end: Date };
  entities?: string[];
  limit?: number;
  minSimilarity?: number;
}
```

### API Endpoints
