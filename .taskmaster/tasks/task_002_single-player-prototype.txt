# Task ID: 2
# Title: Hybrid Simulation Engine Integration
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 1
# Priority: high
# Description: Implement hybrid simulation engine with dual-flow processing combining deterministic calculations and natural language analysis, including cross-influence calculations and campaign management.
# Details:
- Hybrid Simulation Engine: Integrate deterministic systems with AI narrative analysis in 10Hz tick processing
- Cross-Influence Calculations: Natural language sentiment affects economic modifiers, public opinion impacts military effectiveness
- Bidirectional Flow: Hard data informs soft intelligence, soft intelligence influences hard calculations
- Natural Language Integration: AI analysis affects population psychology, policy effectiveness, military morale
- Simulation Output Enhancement: Both numerical KPIs AND narrative analysis results for each tick
- Memory Integration: Use civilization memory context for enhanced AI analysis and narrative generation
- Campaign Creation System: Single-player campaign setup wizard with civilization initialization
- Game State Management: Save/load functionality, campaign branching, timeline management
