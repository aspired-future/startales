# Task ID: 1
# Title: Character & Civilization Memory Enhancement
# Status: in-progress
# Dependencies: None
# Priority: high
# Description: Implement comprehensive memory systems for characters and civilizations including database schema, individual character vector collections, civilization memory system, privacy-aware conversation classification, and migration services.
# Details:
- Database Schema: Create PostgreSQL tables for complete Witter feed (posts, comments, interactions) with perfect recall
- Individual Character Vector Collections: Separate Qdrant collections for each character's personal memory of their own posts and conversations
- Civilization Memory System: Civilization-wide vector collections for shared events, leader speeches, AI analysis, galactic news
- Privacy-Aware Conversation Classification: Store character-player conversations, protect player-player communications
- Migration Service: Move existing gameState Witter posts to database + populate character and civilization vector memories
- Character Personal Memory: Characters remember and can semantically search their own posts and conversations
- Civilization Shared Memory: Store leader speeches, major events, intelligence reports, news for simulation context
- Integrated APIs: Database APIs for global data, vector APIs for personal/civilization memory and context
- Enhanced AI Responses: Characters and systems use appropriate memory context for realistic, consistent behavior

# Test Strategy:


# Subtasks:
## 1. Database Schema Design & Implementation [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Create PostgreSQL schema for Witter posts, comments, interactions with perfect recall
### Details:
- Design witter_posts table (id, character_id, content, timestamp, metadata)
- Design witter_comments table (id, post_id, character_id, content, timestamp)
- Design witter_interactions table (id, post_id, character_id, interaction_type, timestamp)
- Create migration scripts for schema deployment
- Add indexes for performance optimization
- Implement database connection and basic CRUD operations

## 2. Character Vector Memory System [pending]
### Dependencies: 1.1
### Description: Implement individual Qdrant vector collections for each character's personal memory
### Details:
- Design character-specific collection naming scheme (character_memory_{character_id})
- Implement collection creation and management
- Create vector embedding service for character posts and conversations
- Implement semantic search capabilities for character memory
- Add metadata filtering for conversation types and timestamps
- Create character memory retrieval APIs

## 3. Civilization Memory System [pending]
### Dependencies: 1.1
### Description: Implement civilization-wide vector collections for shared events and intelligence
### Details:
- Design civilization memory collection schema (civilization_memory_{civ_id})
- Implement storage for leader speeches, major events, AI analysis outputs
- Create intelligence report storage and retrieval system
- Implement galactic news and event memory
- Add temporal indexing for historical context
- Create civilization memory search and context APIs

## 4. Privacy-Aware Conversation System [pending]
### Dependencies: 1.2, 1.3
### Description: Implement privacy-aware conversation classification and storage
### Details:
- Create conversation type classification (character-player, player-player, alliance, party)
- Implement privacy rules: store character-player, protect player-player/alliance/party
- Design conversation metadata schema with privacy flags
- Create conversation filtering and access control
- Implement automatic conversation categorization
- Add privacy validation and enforcement

## 5. Data Migration Service [pending]
### Dependencies: 1.4
### Description: Create migration service to move existing Witter data to new system
### Details:
- Analyze existing gameState Witter posts structure
- Create migration script to transfer posts to PostgreSQL
- Populate character vector collections with existing posts
- Migrate conversation history to new privacy-aware system
- Validate data integrity after migration
- Create rollback procedures for safety

## 6. API Integration & Endpoints [pending]
### Dependencies: 1.5
### Description: Create comprehensive API integration for memory systems
### Details:
- Design REST API endpoints for Witter database operations
- Create character memory API endpoints for vector search
- Implement civilization memory API for shared context
- Add conversation storage and retrieval APIs
- Create memory context APIs for AI system integration
- Implement real-time memory updates and notifications
