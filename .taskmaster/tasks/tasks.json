Feature must be gated behind preset selection and applied to new campaigns.",
        "details": "Scope and architecture\n- Preset definition\n  - Create a CampaignPreset registry keyed by enum: DEFAULT_SUBSCRIPTION_DEPTH.\n  - Preset sets defaults: pointsVisibility=private, leaderboardScope=off, failForward=strict (configurable), progression model=levels+perks+artifacts, crewAchievements=enabled, softFailCredit=enabled.\n  - Hook preset into campaign creation flow so new campaigns default to this preset unless user chooses another.\n\n- Progression mechanics integration\n  - Extend rules/progression module to expose: computeXP(missionOutcome, skillChecks, artifactsFound, allianceFeats), level thresholds, perk point allocation, artifact slots and gating.\n  - Implement fail-forward accounting: on failed missions grant reduced XP and soft credit toward next mission gate. Add tunables in preset for fraction (e.g., 30–50%).\n  - Record per-mission private points (telemetry only) separate from public scores table; do not emit leaderboard updates in this preset.\n\n- Achievements system\n  - Definitions: per-player and per-crew achievements with fields: id, scope (player|crew), name, description, rarity, category, unlockConditions (DSL or JSON: missionCompletions>=N, skillChecks[DC>=X] success count, collectArtifact[set], allianceFeat[raidX], time-bounded), rewards (xp, items, titles), icon, enabled, version.\n  - Unlocks: per subject table to store unlocked achievements with timestamps, campaign_id, subject_id, version, reward_granted flag; include progress tracking for incremental achievements.\n  - Evaluators: event-driven evaluators subscribing to rules and mission events; incremental progress updates and final unlock with idempotent reward grant.\n  - Notifications: lightweight in-session banner/toast with accessibility labels; queue dedupe; batch multiple unlocks.\n\n- Campaign-level toggles\n  - Expose settings on campaign model: pointsVisibility (private|friends|public), leaderboardScope (off|friends), failForwardStrictness (off|lenient|strict). Enforce at API and UI. For this preset: default private/off/strict, but allow owner to adjust within allowed bounds (no public leaderboard in this preset).\n\n- Privacy and isolation\n  - Ensure no writes to leaderboard tables when leaderboardScope=off; guard in service layer. Enforce DB constraints or service checks to prevent cross-campaign leakage. Ensure vector memory namespaces remain campaign:<id> and player:<id> only.\n\n- Telemetry\n  - Event schema: achievement_progress, achievement_unlocked, mission_points_recorded, perk_allocated, artifact_acquired. Only stored locally; redact PII; ensure pointsVisibility=private prevents any external export.\n\n- Database schema (migrations)\n  - achievements_definitions(id PK, scope, key UNIQUE, name, description, rarity, category, conditions JSON, rewards JSON, icon, enabled, version, created_at).\n  - achievements_unlocks(id PK, campaign_id, scope, subject_id, def_id FK, progress JSON, unlocked_at NULLABLE, reward_granted BOOL, UNIQUE(campaign_id, scope, subject_id, def_id)).\n  - telemetry_points(id PK, campaign_id, player_id NULLABLE, mission_id, points INT, reason TEXT, created_at).\n  - progression_state(id PK, campaign_id, player_id, level INT, xp INT, perk_points INT, artifacts JSONB).\n  - campaign_settings add: preset enum, points_visibility, leaderboard_scope, fail_forward_strictness.\n\n- API\n  - POST /campaigns with preset selection (applies defaults). PATCH /campaigns/:id/settings for toggles with validation.\n  - GET /achievements/definitions?scope=player|crew, GET /achievements/unlocks/:subject, POST /achievements/claim/:unlockId (idempotent claim if rewards require claim), POST /progression/perk-allocate.\n  - POST /telemetry/mission-points (internal server call) stores private points when missions resolve.\n\n- UI\n  - Achievements panel: filter by All/Unlocked/Locked, categories; show progress bars; claim button when applicable. Respect scope switch between Player and Crew for current campaign.\n  - Lightweight banner/toast for unlocks with small icon, title, reward summary; queue with max display rate; accessible and non-blocking.\n  - Campaign Settings for this preset: radio/selectors for points visibility (private only with info tooltip), leaderboard scope (off or friends-only disabled state note), fail-forward strictness; preset badge and description.\n  - Indicate that leaderboards are disabled in this preset in any leaderboard UI, and suggest switching modes (without enabling here).\n\n- Security & performance\n  - Validate all preset toggle updates server-side; reject public leaderboard in this preset.\n  - Idempotency keys for unlock/reward claims to prevent duplication on retries.\n  - Ensure vector index namespace resolution uses campaign_id guard; add unit tests around it. No external writes for telemetry or achievements.\n\n- Data seeding\n  - Provide initial achievements set: examples — First Steps (first mission), Skillful (10 DC15+ successes), Relic Hunter (collect 3 artifacts), United We Stand (crew completes alliance feat), Unstoppable (complete mission after prior fail).\n  - Provide XP curve defaults and sample perks.\n\n- Feature flagging\n  - Gate all UI and API behind preset feature and a server flag to allow staged rollout.\n",

Provide full tests (unit/integration/UI/API), rate limiting, and campaign isolation; preset is disabled by default and can be toggled per campaign.",
        "details": "Scope and architecture\n- Preset definition and registry\n  - Extend CampaignPreset registry with enum: VIRAL_SCORING. Preset flags: publicScores=opt-in, leaderboardScope=friends|campaign|global, seasons=enabled, featuredMissions=weekly, allowSharing=opt-in, redactPII=on, storageMode=local-only-compliant, antiGriefing=on, eloEnabled=per-arena, partialCredit=soft-fail enabled. Disabled by default; selectable per campaign in settings UI and during creation wizard.\n  - Add campaign-level toggles: enablePublicScores, leaderboardScope, enableSeasons, shareDefaults (opt-in off), allianceScoreInclusion, seasonSchedule (start, end, grace), and rewardTiers.\n\n- Data model (SQLite)\n  - Tables (new): scores(id, campaign_id, session_id, mission_id, player_id, team_id, scope, metric, value, partial, fail_reason, created_at); seasons(id, campaign_id, name, scope, start_at, end_at, rollover_state, rewards_schema, version); season_entries(id, season_id, player_id, team_id, rank, mmr, division, elo_mu, elo_sigma, last_update); share_artifacts(id, campaign_id, score_id, artifact_type, url_or_blobref, pii_redacted JSON, created_at, consent_at); featured_missions(id, campaign_id, mission_id, week_of, curated_by).\n  - Migrations: create indices on (campaign_id, scope, metric, created_at), (season_id, rank DESC), and composite unique keys to prevent duplicate submissions per mission attempt.\n\n- Scoring formulas and soft-fail\n  - Implement a scoring module keyed by missionType: time-attack, survival, puzzle, social-coop, arena. Each defines base points, bonuses, penalties, and clamps. Support partial credit on soft-fail: grant proportional points based on progress fraction, with anti-exploit caps.\n  - Fair-play checks: validate mission completion evidence, server-side timestamps, min duration thresholds, attempt cooldowns, host consent for social missions, and client signature verification (reuse adapter auth if present). Rate limit score submissions per player and per campaign.\n\n- Anti-griefing and security\n  - Timeouts: enforce max attempt duration; auto-abort stale submissions. Consent gates: for team scores, require majority consent or GM approval. Cross-campaign isolation: all queries filtered by campaign_id and leaderboard scope; add row-level guards in access layer.\n  - Validation: reject out-of-bounds values; detect suspicious streaks; quarantine flagged scores pending review.\n\n- Seasonal leaderboards and rollover\n  - Implement seasonal versioning: active season per campaign/scope; archived seasons are immutable snapshots with view filters. Provide monthly/quarterly schedules and manual admin rollover. Compute standings on event update and via periodic job; freeze during grace period. Support divisions and ranks for large populations; include alliance/crew aggregates.\n\n- ELO/MMR for arenas\n  - Arena matches update MMR per outcome with K-factor scaling by uncertainty; maintain elo_mu/sigma for Bayesian variants. Persist per season. Calibrate initial placement matches; decay on inactivity. Expose API to fetch matchmaking band.\n\n- Rewards and featured missions\n  - Cosmetic season rewards generation based on final rank/percentile and achievement thresholds. Weekly featured missions rotation: auto-select based on engagement signals with manual override.\n\n- Sharing and privacy\n  - Share flows: generate share_artifacts with opt-in consent; render redacted cards (hide PII, show campaign-safe names). Provide copy-link and image export; ensure local-only storage compliance (no external uploads unless configured). Include per-scope badges (friends/global/campaign) in the artifact.\n\n- UI integration\n  - Preset settings pane: toggles, schedule editor, reward tiers editor, privacy controls. Leaderboards views: current season, friends, global (if enabled), past seasons, alliance standings; entry detail with share action. Share dialog with preview and consent checkbox.\n\n- APIs\n  - POST /scores/submit; GET /leaderboards?scope&season; POST /seasons/rollover; GET /seasons/current; POST /share/create; GET /featured-missions; POST /featured-missions/override. Enforce rate limits and schema validation. Contract tests included.\n\n- Performance\n  - Incremental leaderboard updates with upsert + denormalized standings table; background recompute for heavy scopes. Bounded history retention for hot paths; archive to cold tables. Apply submission rate limits (per IP/player) and exponential backoff on abuse.\n\n- Compatibility and toggles\n  - Integrate with alliances/teams so alliance and crew achievements contribute to seasonal standings when enabled. Respect campaign preset defaults; no cross-talk with other presets. Disabled by default for all existing campaigns until explicitly selected.\n\nReferences and rationale\n- Implement seasonal versioning and resets modeled after established practices for seasonal leaderboards to keep competition fresh[3].\n- Apply best practices for leaderboard scopes, reset cycles, and community health to mitigate toxicity and maintain engagement[2][1].\n- Support divisions/ranks concepts akin to league systems to scale competition fairly across skill bands[5].",
        "testStrategy": "Unit tests\n- Scoring math per mission type: deterministic outputs for boundary cases; partial credit proportionality; clamp and cap behaviors. Fuzz against invalid inputs to ensure rejection and quarantine.\n- ELO/MMR updates: verify K-factor scaling, placement matches, win/loss/draw updates, inactivity decay, and season scoping.\n- Season schedule: compute active/archived state, grace period logic, and rollover versioning.\n\nIntegration tests\n- Leaderboard updates: submit scores concurrently; verify standings update correctly, alliance aggregates reflect member contributions, and per-campaign isolation holds. Validate friends vs campaign vs global scopes.\n- Season rollover: run end-of-season; freeze submissions; archive standings; create next season; rewards issuance; verify no mutations to archived season.\n- Rate limiting and anti-griefing: exceed submission thresholds; ensure 429s and quarantine flow; validate consent gates for team submissions; timeouts on stale attempts.\n- Featured missions: weekly rotation triggers; manual override persists; UI surfaces current featured set.\n\nUI tests (Playwright)\n- Preset selection: ensure VIRAL_SCORING appears, is disabled by default, and can be enabled per campaign.\n- Leaderboards views: paginate, filter by scope, switch current/past seasons, view alliance standings, open share dialog, confirm PII redaction and consent requirement.\n- Share flows: create artifact, copy link/image export, verify privacy banner and opt-in remembered per user.\n\nAPI contract tests\n- /scores/submit validation and idempotency; /leaderboards query combinations; /seasons/rollover permissions and effects; /share/create artifact schema; /featured-missions endpoints.

        "details": "Scope and architecture\n- Channel model\n  - Channel types: GLOBAL (one per campaign, All‑Hands) and AD_HOC.\n  - Properties: id, campaign_id, type, name, description, is_invite_only, created_by, created_at, updated_at, archived_at, voice_room_id (nullable), text_retention_days, default_join_muted.\n  - Memberships: id, channel_id, user_id, role (owner|mod|member), mute (self), volume (0–100), joined_at, left_at (nullable), is_present_in_voice (derived from voice engine presence).\n  - Invites: id, channel_id, inviter_id, invitee_id, status (pending|accepted|declined|expired|revoked), expires_at, created_at, rate_limit_bucket.\n  - Channel events (audit): id, channel_id, actor_id, event_type (create|update|delete|join|leave|invite_create|invite_accept|invite_decline|role_change|mute|kick), payload (JSON), created_at.\n  - Text messages: reuse existing messages table if present; otherwise define messages(id, channel_id, author_id, content, kind=text|caption|system, ts, ref (optional)). Transcripts store STT captions as messages with kind=caption and diarization metadata.\n\n- API design\n  - REST\n    - POST /channels (create ad‑hoc; enforce campaign scope; assign owner)\n    - GET /channels (list by campaign with membership and unread counts)\n    - GET /channels/:id (details, last N messages, membership summary)\n    - PATCH /channels/:id (name, invite_only, description) – owner/mod only\n    - DELETE /channels/:id (archive) – owner only for ad‑hoc; GLOBAL cannot be deleted\n    - POST /channels/:id/members/join (join; default muted in voice)\n    - POST /channels/:id/members/leave (leave; owner transfer/constraints)\n    - POST /channels/:id/members/:userId/roles (role transition; auth checks)\n    - POST /channels/:id/moderation/mute (self or mod‑enforced target)\n    - POST /channels/:id/moderation/kick (remove from membership; mod/owner)\n    - POST /channels/:id/invites (create; rate limited; invite_only respected)\n    - POST /channels/:id/invites/:inviteId/accept\n    - POST /channels/:id/invites/:inviteId/decline\n  - WebSocket events (namespaced by campaign)\n    - channel.created/updated/archived\n    - channel.member.joined/left/role_changed\n    - channel.invite.created/accepted/declined\n    - channel.moderation.muted/kicked\n    - channel.voice.presence (join/leave/talking/VAD)\n    - channel.text.message (text and caption kinds)\n    - channel.audit.appended\n\n- Voice integration\n  - On channel join, create/ensure voice room mapping (voice_room_id) and attach presence to membership; default join muted; push‑to‑talk and VAD states reflected in WS presence events.\n  - Per‑channel mute/volume stored in membership; client applies volume locally; server tracks mute for moderation and signaling.\n  - Captions/diarization: consume STT pipeline outputs and emit as channel.text.message with kind=caption, speaker tag (connection/user id), timestamps; store in transcripts/messages.\n\n- Text integration\n  - Message history per channel; pagination by ts+id; captions appear inline with badges; system messages for invites/joins/leaves.\n  - Moderation deletes redact content and append audit event.\n\n- Security and isolation\n  - All endpoints authorize campaign membership; channels cannot cross campaigns; per‑action role checks; enforce invite_only: only invited users can join; global channel membership allowed to all campaign users but can be left/joined.\n  - Rate limit invites per inviter+channel (e.g., 10/min, 100/day) with backoff and 429 responses.\n  - Validate WS subscriptions to campaign and channel membership; no leakage across campaigns.\n\n- Database schema (SQL sketch)\n  - channels(id PK, campaign_id FK, type, name, description, is_invite_only, voice_room_id, default_join_muted, text_retention_days, created_by, created_at, updated_at, archived_at)\n  - channel_memberships(id PK, channel_id FK, user_id FK, role, mute, volume, joined_at, left_at)\n  - channel_invites(id PK, channel_id FK, inviter_id FK, invitee_id FK, status, expires_at, created_at, updated_at)\n  - channel_events(id PK, channel_id FK, actor_id FK, event_type, payload JSONB, created_at)\n  - channel_messages(id PK, channel_id FK, author_id FK NULL for system/captions, kind, content TEXT/JSON, ts, meta JSONB)\n  - Indexes: by campaign_id, (channel_id, ts DESC), unique (channel_id, user_id) active membership, invite dedupe (channel_id, invitee_id, status='pending').\n\n- UI/UX\n  - Channel list/switcher scoped to campaign; global channel pinned/bannered; unread badges; voice presence dots.\n  - Create channel dialog: name, invite_only, initial invites; role shown as owner for creator.\n  - Invite notifications: toast + inbox; accept/decline; deep‑link to channel.\n  - Per‑channel controls: join/leave, push‑to‑talk toggle, VAD toggle, mute/volume slider; captions pane; message composer.\n  - Accessibility: keyboard PTT, ARIA live for captions, color contrast; localized strings; dark/light.\n\n- Event sourcing and audit\n  - Emit channel_events for all state mutations; include actor_id, reason/message; render minimal audit feed for mods.\n\n- Migration and seeding\n  - On campaign creation, auto‑create GLOBAL All‑Hands channel with default_join_muted=true and captions on.\n\n- Performance\n  - Backpressure on WS text/caption streams; coalesce presence updates; message send debouncing; pagination size defaults; apply existing WS reconnection policies.\n\n- Error handling and edge cases\n  - Owner leave requires transfer or archive; prevent removing last owner; invite accept auto‑joins channel; decline keeps audit.\n  - Kicks remove from voice and membership; surface reason to target; prevent rejoin if invite_only and no invite.\n\nImplementation notes\n- Backend: TypeScript (Node) services; reuse existing WS hub; zod validation; transactional writes for membership/invite flows; outbox pattern to emit WS after commit.\n- Client: React; state via existing store; optimistic UI for text; reconcile on WS acks; persistent per‑channel audio settings in local storage.\n- Telemetry: log invite rate‑limit hits, moderation actions, errors; redact PII in events.\n",
        "testStrategy": "Unit tests (server)\n- Authorization and role enforcement: create/update/delete channel; role transitions with constraints; moderation mute/kick auth; prevent cross‑campaign access.\n- Invite lifecycle: create (rate‑limited), accept (auto‑join), decline, revoke/expire; dedupe pending invites per user/channel; audit events emitted.\n- Membership: join/leave; default join muted; owner transfer and last‑owner guard; unique active membership per user/channel.\n- Text routing: messages stored and broadcast to channel members only; captions stored with kind=caption and diarization metadata.\n- Audit logs: verify channel_events appended for all mutations with correct payloads.\n\nIntegration/API tests\n- CRUD: create ad‑hoc channel, update props, archive; global channel existence per campaign and non‑deletable guard.\n- Membership flows: join/leave endpoints; per‑channel mute/volume updates persisted; kick removes voice presence and membership.\n- Invites: create -> invitee receives WS invite; accept -> becomes member; decline -> no membership; rate‑limit returns 429 with reset header.\n- WS sequencing: subscribe to campaign; assert event order and idempotency on reconnect; presence/talking events throttled.\n- Voice/text coupling: join channel -> voice room presence mirrors membership; captions received in text stream; push‑to‑talk/VAD state reflected in presence events.\n\nUI (Playwright)\n- Global channel banner visible; join/leave/mute and volume work and persist; captions visible with ARIA live.\n- Create ad‑hoc channel; invite flow end‑to‑end (create, notify, accept/decline); membership roles displayed; permissions UI enforced.\n- Send/receive text and captions; unread counts and switcher updates; invite notifications actionable.\n\nNon‑functional\n- Rate limits honored under load; invite burst blocked; WS reconnect maintains channel subscriptions and resyncs last cursor.\n- Privacy/isolation: cross‑campaign access attempts denied in API and WS; no events leaked in multi‑campaign test.\n- Persistence: pagination returns stable ordering; retention purger (if configured) removes old messages without breaking pagination.\n",

        "description": "Create the React component library structure in src/ui_frontend matching framework_docs/ui_visual_design.md, implement dark-theme tokens with Tailwind/CSS variables, wire to mocked APIs, and add Storybook/Ladle with accessibility and testing gates (Jest/RTL, Playwright+MSW, visual regression).",
        "details": "Scope and deliverables\n- Create src/ui_frontend/ui with component folders matching the visual layout: TopBar, ChannelsList, PartyPanel, SceneMedia, NPCRoster, QuickIntents, ObjectivesPanel, SituationTicker, AchievementsToasts, TranscriptChat, Modals/ChannelManager, Modals/InviteDialog.\n- For each component:\n  - Files: Component.tsx, Component.stories.tsx, Component.test.tsx, Component.accessibility.test.tsx, index.ts, styles.css (or .module.css if not using Tailwind), and fixtures.mock.ts.\n  - Export public components via src/ui_frontend/ui/index.ts and aggregated src/ui_frontend/index.ts for app consumption.\n  - Add data-testid values exactly as defined in framework_docs/ui_visual_design.md; fail builds if mismatched.\n  - Props: accept minimal props per ASCII wireframes (titles, counts, selected states, lists) and callbacks (onSelectChannel, onToggleMute, onOpenInvite, etc.). No real backend calls.\n- Theming and styles\n  - Default dark theme using CSS variables in :root[data-theme='dark'] and an optional Tailwind config using theme tokens. Define core tokens: color.bg, color.panel, color.text, color.text-muted, color.accent, color.error, elevation.s, elevation.m, radius.s|m, spacing scale, typography tokens.\n  - Support prefers-color-scheme: dark by default; provide a simple ThemeProvider that toggles data-theme on <html>.\n- State management and mocking\n  - Components are primarily presentational; create lightweight container/demo mocks in stories using MSW to simulate API data for: channel list, invites, transcript stream, achievements toasts, ticker items.\n  - Provide a shared mock service worker setup for Storybook and Playwright.\n- Storybook (or Ladle) setup\n  - Configure Storybook with @storybook/addon-a11y, @storybook/addon-interactions, and storybook-addon-msw. Provide stories for happy path and edge states (empty lists, long names, overflow, error banners).\n  - Global decorators for ThemeProvider and MSW.\n- Playwright scaffold\n  - E2E smoke for main layout shell rendering all panels, opening InviteDialog from TopBar/ChannelManager, toggling mute, switching ChannelsList selection. Use MSW to intercept API calls. Add data-testid hooks per design.\n- Visual regression\n  - Capture baseline snapshots for TopBar, ChannelsList, PartyPanel, ObjectivesPanel, SituationTicker, TranscriptChat, AchievementsToasts in both default and edge cases.\n- Accessibility\n  - ARIA roles/labels per component: navigation/menubar for TopBar, list/listitem for ChannelsList, dialog role with labelledby/ describedby for modals, log or feed role for TranscriptChat/Ticker, status for AchievementsToasts, buttons and toggle buttons with aria-pressed for mute.\n- Project wiring\n  - Ensure components are isolated from backend; all data via props or MSW mocks. Provide a mockApi.ts with handlers for channels, invites, presence toggles.\n  - Add npm scripts: ui:storybook, ui:test, ui:e2e, ui:validate-testids.\n- Docs\n  - Add framework_docs/COMPONENTS_README.md describing structure, tokens, test IDs, and story usage.\n\nImplementation notes and examples\n- File structure example\n  - src/ui_frontend/ui/TopBar/TopBar.tsx\n  - src/ui_frontend/ui/TopBar/TopBar.stories.tsx\n  - src/ui_frontend/ui/TopBar/TopBar.test.tsx\n  - src/ui_frontend/ui/TopBar/TopBar.accessibility.test.tsx\n  - src/ui_frontend/ui/TopBar/index.ts\n  - Repeat for all components and Modals/ChannelManager, Modals/InviteDialog.\n- Tailwind option\n  - tailwind.config.ts extends with cssVar-based colors: colors: { bg: 'var(--color-bg)', panel: 'var(--color-panel)', text: 'var(--color-text)', accent: 'var(--color-accent)' }.\n- Data contracts for mocks\n  - Channel {id, name, unreadCount, isMuted, isSelected, type}\n  - Invite {id, channelId, inviter, createdAt, status}\n  - TranscriptItem {id, speaker, text, timestamp}\n  - TickerItem {id, type, message, severity}\n\nNon-goals\n- No backend integration, websockets, or persistence.\n- No provider adapters or voice pipeline wiring here.\n",
        "testStrategy": "Unit tests (Jest + React Testing Library)\n- Props/state rendering: verify labels, counts, selected state, and callbacks fire for TopBar, ChannelsList, PartyPanel, etc.\n- Data-testid presence: assert every element defined in ui_visual_design.md exists with exact IDs; add a test that parses the doc and checks IDs where feasible.\n- Accessibility: axe-core checks per component; roles/labels and keyboard nav: focus trap in dialogs, Escape to close, Tab order, Space/Enter activate.\n\nVisual/regression tests\n- For key panels (TopBar, ChannelsList, PartyPanel, ObjectivesPanel, SituationTicker, TranscriptChat, AchievementsToasts), render deterministic stories and capture baseline images; assert diffs < threshold in CI.\n\nPlaywright E2E smoke (with MSW)\n- Load main layout story/preview; verify all primary regions visible.\n- Open InviteDialog via TopBar/ChannelManager; fill and submit; MSW returns success; dialog closes and toast shows.\n- Toggle mute button (aria-pressed toggles, icon changes).\n- Switch channels: click different list items; selection state and panel header update.\n\nAcceptance checks\n- Visual comparison against ASCII wireframes in ui_visual_design.md passes review.\n- Dark theme tokens applied; components respect tokens.\n- All tests green in CI: lint, typecheck, unit, a11y, visual, and Playwright smoke.",
