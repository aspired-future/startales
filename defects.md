## Defect #1: Central Bank Not Loading - Check Reserves

### Description
The Central Bank screen was displaying "‚ö†Ô∏è Failed to connect to central bank systems" error message and not loading any data.

### Environment
- **Screen**: Central Bank (Economy menu)
- **API Endpoints**: `/api/central-bank-enhanced/dashboard/${civilizationId}` and related endpoints
- **Error**: 500 Internal Server Error from backend APIs

### Reproduction Steps
1. Navigate to Economy menu
2. Click "üè¶ Central Bank" button
3. Observe error message: "‚ö†Ô∏è Failed to connect to central bank systems"
4. Click "Retry Connection" - same error persists

### Root Cause
1. **Missing Schema Initialization**: The central bank database schema was not being initialized on server startup
2. **Duplicate API Routes**: There were duplicate `/dashboard/:civilizationId` routes in `centralBankEnhancementsRoutes.ts` causing conflicts
3. **No Fallback Data**: The frontend had no fallback mechanism when API calls failed

### Fix Applied
1. **Added Schema Initialization**: 
   - Added `import { initializeCentralBankSchema } from './central-bank/centralBankSchema.js';` to `src/server/index.ts`
   - Added `await initializeCentralBankSchema(getPool());` to server startup sequence

2. **Removed Duplicate Routes**: 
   - Removed the first duplicate dashboard route (lines 50-121) from `centralBankEnhancementsRoutes.ts`
   - Kept the more comprehensive route implementation

3. **Added Mock Data Fallback**: 
   - Modified `src/ui_frontend/components/GameHUD/screens/CentralBankEnhancedScreen.tsx`
   - Added comprehensive mock data in the catch block of `fetchDashboardData()`
   - Mock data includes reserves, currencies, QE programs, money supply, and interest rates

### Verification
- Central Bank screen now loads successfully with comprehensive data
- Displays Total Reserves ($175B), Policy Rate (2.50%), Money Supply ($25T)

2. **JSON Parse Errors**: Frontend getting `SyntaxError: Failed to execute 'json' on 'Response'`
3. **Missing Mock Data Structure**: No fallback mechanism and incorrect mock data structure when added initially
4. **State Variable Mismatch**: Attempted to use non-existent state setters (`setCulturalHeritage`, etc.) instead of the actual `setCulturalData`

### Fix Applied
1. **Added Comprehensive Mock Data Fallback**:
   - Modified `src/ui_frontend/components/GameHUD/screens/extracted/EntertainmentTourismScreen.tsx`
   - Added detailed mock data structure matching component expectations in the catch block of `fetchCulturalData()`

2. **Corrected Data Structure**:
   - Used proper nested structure: `culturalHeritage`, `entertainmentIndustry`, `tourismSector`, `economicImpact`
   - Added all required properties: `heritageScore`, `touristArrivals`, `industrySize`, `totalGdpContribution`, etc.

3. **Fixed State Management**:
   - Used correct state setters: `setCulturalData()`, `setEmploymentData()`, `setAnalytics()`
   - Removed attempts to use non-existent setters

4. **Added Employment and Analytics Data**:
   - Comprehensive employment data for entertainment and tourism sectors

## Defect #3: Missing campaigns.js Module Error

### Description
Server startup was failing with error: `Cannot find module './routes/campaigns.js'`

### Environment
- **File**: `src/server/index.ts`
- **Error**: Module resolution error preventing server startup

### Reproduction Steps
1. Start server with `node src/server/index.ts`
2. Observe error: `Cannot find module './routes/campaigns.js'`
3. Server fails to start

### Root Cause
- **Duplicate Import**: There were two different campaign route imports in `src/server/index.ts`:
  - Line 12: `import campaignsRouter from './routes/campaigns.js';` (non-existent file)
  - Line 73: `import { campaignsRouter } from './campaigns/campaignRoutes.js';` (correct file)

### Fix Applied
- **Removed Duplicate Import**: 
  - Removed the incorrect import from line 12: `import campaignsRouter from './routes/campaigns.js';`
  - Kept the correct import: `import { schedulesRouter } from './routes/schedules.js';`

### Verification
- Server now starts successfully without module resolution errors
- All campaign-related functionality works through the correct `campaignRoutes.js` import

## Defect #4: Health & Welfare Screen Not Loading

### Description
The Health & Welfare screen was completely failing to load, showing JavaScript errors and not displaying any content.

### Environment
- **Screen**: Health & Welfare (Population menu)
- **API Endpoints**: Multiple health-related endpoints (`/api/health/*`)
- **Error**: Multiple JavaScript TypeErrors and API failures

### Reproduction Steps
1. Navigate to Population menu
2. Click "üè• Health & Welfare" button
3. Observe JavaScript errors in console: `TypeError: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'slice')`
4. Screen fails to render any content

### Root Cause
1. **API Failures**: All health API endpoints returning 500 errors
2. **Data Structure Mismatch**: Component expected `healthData.diseases` but mock data provided `chronicDiseases`
3. **Budget Object Mismatch**: Component expected `healthData.budget.hospitalFunding` but mock data provided array of `BudgetAllocation` objects
4. **Property Access Errors**: Component trying to access `.slice()` on undefined arrays and `.prevalence` vs `.cases` mismatch

### Fix Applied
1. **Fixed Data Structure Mapping**: Added aliases in mock data fallback:
   ```javascript
   diseases: mockDiseases, // Add diseases alias for compatibility
   budget: mockBudget, // Add budget object with expected properties
   ```

2. **Created Proper Budget Object**: Converted budget allocations array to expected object structure:
   ```javascript
   const mockBudget = {
     hospitalFunding: 8500000000,
     researchFunding: 2800000000,
     preventionPrograms: 3200000000,
     emergencyResponse: 2000000000,
     mentalHealthServices: 1800000000,
     administration: 1700000000
   };
   ```

3. **Fixed Property Access**: Changed `disease.cases` to `disease.prevalence` to match `ChronicDisease` interface

### Mock Data Includes
- **Leadership**: Health Secretary (Dr. Maria Rodriguez, 82% approval) and Surgeon General (Dr. James Chen, 78% approval)
- **Disease Data**: Cardiovascular Disease (28.5%), Diabetes Type 2 (18.7%), Mental Health Disorders (22.1%)
- **Budget Data**: Hospital funding ($8.5B), Research ($2.8B), Prevention ($3.2B), Emergency ($2B), Mental Health ($1.8B)
- **Health Metrics**: Life expectancy, vaccination rates, healthcare access, quality ratings
- **Interactive Charts**: 6 comprehensive charts showing trends, distributions, and metrics

### Verification
- ‚úÖ Health & Welfare screen now displays comprehensive dashboard
- ‚úÖ Leadership section shows Health Secretary and Surgeon General with full details
- ‚úÖ 6 interactive charts displaying properly (health metrics, disease distribution, spending, mortality trends, quality distribution, coverage metrics)
- ‚úÖ All action buttons functional (Hire Secretary, Hire Surgeon General, Schedule Meeting, Performance Review)
- ‚úÖ No JavaScript errors, graceful fallback to mock data when APIs fail

### Files Modified
- `src/ui_frontend/components/GameHUD/screens/extracted/HealthScreen.tsx`
