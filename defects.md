## Previously Resolved Issues

### API Container Stability Issues - RESOLVED ‚úÖ
- **Issue**: Docker container exit code 139 causing restart loops
- **Root Cause**: Segmentation fault from missing dependencies and signal handling
- **Resolution**: Added `curl` and `dumb-init` packages, implemented non-root user, added health checks
- **Date Resolved**: Previous development cycle

### PostgreSQL Integration - RESOLVED ‚úÖ
- **Issue**: Application crashes when PostgreSQL unavailable
- **Root Cause**: Synchronous connection attempts without error handling  
- **Resolution**: Implemented lazy connection pooling with comprehensive error handling
- **Date Resolved**: Previous development cycle

### Port Configuration - RESOLVED ‚úÖ  
- **Issue**: Port mismatch between Docker expectations (4000) and application default (4018)
- **Resolution**: Standardized on PORT=4010 environment variable with health endpoint
- **Date Resolved**: Previous development cycle

### Demo Route Misplacement - RESOLVED ‚úÖ
- **Issue**: In `src/demo/index.ts`, the `app.use(demographicsDemo);` line was incorrectly positioned after the technology API routes instead of after the demographics API routes
- **Root Cause**: Copy-paste error during system integration
- **Resolution**: Moved `demographicsDemo` route to correct position after `app.use('/api/demographics', demographicsRoutes);`
- **Date Resolved**: During AI Analysis Engine integration (Task 69)

### PowerShell Command Compatibility - NOTED ‚ö†Ô∏è
- **Issue**: Various PowerShell-specific command syntax issues (`curl`, `docker`, `head`, `&&` operators)
- **Root Cause**: PowerShell aliases and syntax differences from bash/zsh
- **Status**: Noted but not blocking development - commands work in appropriate shell environments
- **Workaround**: Use appropriate shell environment or modify commands for PowerShell compatibility

## Database Architecture - STABLE ‚úÖ
**Dual Database System**:
- **PostgreSQL**: Relational data (planets, systems, campaigns, conversations, vector memory)
- **SQLite**: Event sourcing (trade operations, campaign state changes)
